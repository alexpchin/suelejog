Ruby, my trusty steed, relies 100% on my pedal power. Having researched appropriate nutrition for LEJOG, I realised that eating an extra banana each day isn't going to be enough to drive me along the 1011 miles and up more than 62,000 ft of hills.

I read an interesting article about ‘Bonking on the Bike’. I have to admit my motivation to read it was aligned to a curiosity about how one manages to maintain balance. Two sentences in, I realised that the article was about ‘hitting the wall’ rather than any sexual practice which would include Ruby and a 3<sup>rd</sup> party!

So, to avoid ‘Bonking on the Bike’, I've calculated that I’ll need to consume about 5,500 calories each day – a significantly increased number versus my pre-training intake of 2,000. To many, that would be a dream, but it's not easy to increase to this level and maintain good nutrition. I’ll be focusing on ensuring that carbs and protein are high enough with plenty of healthy, calorie-dense foods aboard the support vehicle. Standard foodstuffs will be supplemented with:

**Performance carbohydrate TORQ Bars - Pineapple and Ginger flavour**

*Painstakingly formulated to produce a food that is ultra high in carbohydrate, very low in fat and with ingredients wide-ranging in glycaemic index for immediate and sustained glucose release. Just as important, this bar has been designed to taste great with a cup of tea too!*
