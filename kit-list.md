Ruby, my trusty steed, relies 100% on my pedal power. Having researched appropriate nutrition for LEJOG, I realised that eating an extra banana each day isn't going to be enough to drive me along the 1011 miles and up more than 62,000 ft of hills.

I read an interesting article about ‘Bonking on the Bike’. I have to admit my motivation to read it was aligned to a curiosity about how one manages to maintain balance. Two sentences in, I realised that the article was about ‘hitting the wall’ rather than any sexual practice which would include Ruby and a 3<sup>rd</sup> party!

So, to avoid ‘Bonking on the Bike’, I've calculated that I’ll need to consume about 5,500 calories each day – a significantly increased number versus my pre-training intake of 2,000. To many, that would be a dream, but it's not easy to increase to this level and maintain good nutrition. I’ll be focusing on ensuring that carbs and protein are kept high enough during the day with plenty of healthy, calorie-dense foods aboard the support vehicle, and I intend to make the most of evening meals with friends to build reserves for the following day!

Standard foodstuffs will be supplemented with:
