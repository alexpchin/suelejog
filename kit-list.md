Ruby, my trusty steed, relies 100% on my pedal power. Having researched appropriate nutrition for LEJOG, I realised that eating an extra banana each day isn't going to be enough to drive me along the 1011 miles and up more than 62,000 ft of hills.

I read an interesting article about ‘Bonking on the Bike’. I have to admit my motivation to read it was aligned to a curiosity about how one manages to maintain balance. Two sentences in, I realised that the article was about ‘hitting the wall’ rather than any sexual practice which would include Ruby and a 3<sup>rd</sup> party!

So, to avoid ‘Bonking on the Bike’, I've calculated that I’ll need to consume about 5,500 calories each day – a significantly increased number versus my pre-training intake of 2,000. To many, that would be a dream, but it's not easy to increase to this level and maintain good nutrition. I’ll be focusing on ensuring that carbs and protein are kept high enough during the day with plenty of healthy, calorie-dense foods aboard the support vehicle, and I intend to make the most of evening meals with friends to build reserves for the following day!

Standard foodstuffs will be supplemented with:

**Performance carbohydrate with Ribose [TORQ Bars](http://www.torqfitness.co.uk/nutrition/torq-bar) - Pineapple and Ginger**

*Painstakingly formulated to produce a food that is ultra high in carbohydrate, very low in fat and with ingredients wide-ranging in glycaemic index for immediate and sustained glucose release. Just as important, this bar has been designed to taste great with a cup of tea too!*

**Great tasting triple protein blend [SiS Protein Bars](http://www.scienceinsport.com/uk/shop-sis/protein-range/protein-bars?gclid=CPrk4I2opc4CFRYTGwod45EHrg) – Chocolate and Peanut**

*SiS Protein Bars contain a blend of easily digestible proteins (20 grams per bar) in the form of whey, casein and soy protein. Protein intake is often overlooked by endurance athletes. SiS Protein Bars provide an appropriate quantity of high quality protein for before or immediately post exercise.*
