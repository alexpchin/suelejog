  bio: 'Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars. Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’ Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and London to Paris cycle rides.'
