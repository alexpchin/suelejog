  bio: "Philip's daughter, Rachel, joined Sue on her “absolutely amazing challenge” on Days 5 & 6. Although, by her own admission, not much of a sportswoman herself, Rachel does enjoy watching the ‘Lympics’ with her two-and-three-quarter year old twins, Harper and Tate. She came along as she wanted Sue to know that she has the full support of her family and friends and saw this as a good way of catching up with everyone. When asked about Sue, Rachel said, “Sue is courageous and determined, and is someone who believes in raising money and awareness for her cause. She is so passionate about the challenge that she will succeed.” Rachel also thinks that Sue's zest for challenges will continue and maybe mass participation will be the way forward!"

  bio: "Sue's brother, Chris, surprised her by arriving with partner Ellie on Day 7 of the challenge. At first, Sue didn't realise who the two people holding the CRUK banner at the side of the road were, assuming that they were ‘randomers’ commandeered out of the pub by Jo to join the cheerleading squad. When asked why he'd 'crossed the line' from his native Yorkshire into Lancashire to support Sue, Chris said, \"As she battles with the physical side of her mammoth journey (and I really can’t believe some of those hills she went up), she needs to know that her family and friends are right behind her with every turn of the pedals. Turning up for one day was the least we could do. As always, I am very proud to be Sue’s little bruvver.\""

Always up for an adventure, she also supported Sue by taking on the hills of Hadrian Wall with family and friends in 2012. Cally said, “It was when I was doing Hadrian's Wall that I first noticed Sue's drive and determination, ploughing on up the hills through the rain, and motivating us all to finish the miles every day.” Part of the LEJOG back-up team on Days 5 & 6, Cally wanted to support Sue in this incredible challenge to recognise her tireless work to raise money for Cancer Research UK, as well as lending her support to her sister Jo along the way."

  bio: "Chris and Michael, Jo's Mum and Dad, only met Sue in December 2015, although really do feel as though they have known her for years, as they have heard so much about her. Joining the 'dinner crew' on Day 3 in Axbridge, it was as part of Day 4's support team, driving to Tintern Abbey and onto Goodrich, that they witnessed the distance, sheer physical effort and the huge organisational task involved. Chris said, “We are very much in awe of the enormity of the challenge. We're following the route on a daily basis, Sue and Jo's efforts are very humbling, and we only wish we could be there to join them at John O'Groats at the finish. Sue's challenge is actually overshadowing the Rio 2016 Olympics!"

  bio: "Richard met Sue many years ago through Bayer. He says that it would be rude to say how long ago but suggests that maybe, ‘a significant while’ would do it.\_Arriving to meet the team at Tintern Abbey, Richard said: “Sue has earned the respect of everyone who loves and knows her - a tireless campaigner for Cancer Research UK.\_This epic journey, all 1011 miles from Land’s End to John O’Groats, demonstrates that sometimes actions are as important as words.\_Sue has humbled many of us in her commitment to a cause in which she truly believes — for oh so many reasons. Sue has literally ‘got on her bike’ so it seemed churlish not to get in the car for just a teeny-weeny part of her journey!"

Now in his 60s, he still likes to pull on the Lycra, completing the Coast to Coast cycle route with Sue in 2011; some of the stages of the Yorkshire Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, and has also accompanied Sue her on a few of the training runs prior to LEJOG. Clem was also part of the ‘Inspirites’ team that completed Shine Manchester in 2010 and raised £18,000 in aid of Cancer Research UK.

Over the years, Karen has done a lot of cycling and walking challenges with Sue. She says that Sue is always positive and motivated, and absolutely never complains, even when the going gets tough. On training rides with Sue and Jonny, Karen has gained a reputation for (mis)leading everyone down tracks and gravel paths. Having completed LEJOG in 2010, Karen’s was looking forward to this trip for the scenery and the camaraderie, but also to leaving all the route planning to someone else!'

Never one to do anything by halves, he answered Sue and Jo’s brief for a basic, template-driven blog with an extremely professional looking site, despite only being given an afternoon to put it together. With parents, Jo and Phil, Alex has also taken part in a couple of Sue’s adventures: walking a very wet Hadrian’s Wall in 2012 and joining them on a trekking holiday in the Dolomites in 2011.

  bio: 'Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars. Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’ Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and London to Paris cycle rides.'
