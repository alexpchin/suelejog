  bio: 'Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars. Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’ Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and London to Paris cycle rides.'

  bio: 'Keen cyclist, Jonny, is accompanying Sue on the first three days of her challenge having completed LEJOG himself with wife Karen in 2010. One of Sue’s oldest friends, Sue and Jonny met forty years ago when Sue was a fresher at Newcastle University and Jonny was a local boy on the lookout! Jonny cycles 100-150 km a week and has not only kept Sue company on many of her training rides with Karen but has also helped with the practicalities of getting Sue’s bike and car ready for the trip. Jonny is keen to show his support for the valuable work that Sue does for CRUK and is looking forward to putting all their training into action on the challenging hills of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset.'

  bio: "As Fundraising Manager for Cancer Research UK, Tanisha has supported Sue in her many voluntary activities for the past year. After waving Sue off for Land’s End, Tanisha said, “Sue is an absolute inspiration. She has quite literally made supporting CRUK her life's work - not only lobbying government as an Ambassador but also finding time to undertake personal fundraising challenges like this one and raising the bar every time! Sue is passionate, ambitious and driven, and totally embodies the CRUK beliefs: Sharp minds and brave hearts win; United we are stronger than cancer; and Our stories change the world. Here's wishing Sue, and everyone supporting her on this epic trip, a wonderful and safe challenge.”"

  bio: 'Web development instructor and entrepreneur, Alex, has lent his support to Sue’s LEJOG challenge by building this website. Never one to do anything by halves, he answered Sue and Jo’s brief for a basic, template-driven blog with an extremely professional looking site, despite only being given an afternoon to put it together. With parents, Jo and Phil, Alex has also taken part in a couple of Sue’s adventures: walking a very wet Hadrian’s Wall in 2012 and joining them on a trekking holiday in the Dolomites in 2011. Alex has fond memories of playing golf at Frilford with Sue’s late husband Philip and is pleased to be able to help the indomitable “Barney” as she prepares for her biggest challenge yet!'
- name: Karen

  bio: 'Karen, Sue’s cycling companion for Day 3, met first Sue about 20 years ago, through her husband Jonny. She’s been cycling for 30 years, both on and off road, but says that her cycling has been transformed this year with a new bike - another Ruby! Over the years, Karen has done a lot of cycling and walking challenges with Sue. She says that Sue is always positive and motivated, and absolutely never complains, even when the going gets tough. On training rides with Sue and Jonny, Karen has gained a reputation for (mis)leading everyone down tracks and gravel paths. Having completed LEJOG in 2010, Karen’s was looking forward to this trip for the scenery and the camaraderie, but also to leaving all the route planning to someone else!'

  bio: 'Kay & Richard are two of Jo’s oldest and closest friends. They met Sue in 2015 when Sue, Jo, Jane and Candida stayed at their B&B in Lynmouth whilst training for their Icelandic trek. (The walk from Lynmouth to Coombe Martin along the north Devon coast turned out to be particularly arduous but the welcome that they all received at the Heatherville more than made up for it.) Kay & Richard, daughter Katherine, and grandchildren Noah and Lilah cheered Sue and Karen on as they passed through the Somerset village of Bishop’s Lydeard. Marvelling at Sue’s fitness and determination, Kay & Richard were also struck by how much Jo needed to do to keep the LEJOG show in the road!'
- name: Clem

  bio: 'Sue’s companion cyclist on Day 4, Clem has known Sue for just over 15 years. He has always been interested in cycling and, as a youth, cycled over 500 miles around Wales from Oxford in 5 days. Now in his 60s, he still likes to pull on the Lycra, completing the Coast to Coast cycle route with Sue in 2011; some of the stages of the Yorkshire Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, and has also accompanied Sue her on a few of the training runs prior to LEJOG. Clem was also part of the ‘Inspirites’ team that completed Shine Manchester in 2010 and raised £18,000 in aid of Cancer Research UK. Clem wanted to show his support for Sue’s endeavour by riding alongside her on one of the stages.'
- name: Gill

  bio: 'Gill first met Sue at a friend’s party around the year 2000. In April 2010, she took part in the Manchester Shine overnight marathon walk with Sue, husband Clem and other friends, raising £18,000 for Cancer Research UK. Gill has also supported Sue in her Coast to Coast and London to Paris cycling challenges and enjoyed a cycling holiday in the Loire Valley with Sue and mutual friend Caroline. Gill was particularly keen to support Sue on her Land’s End to John O’Groats challenge because she thought that Sue needed "a little bit of help from her friends.” She is pleased to see so many people turning out to cheer Sue on, and thrilled that the challenge is raising so much money for a charity that’s also close to her heart.'

The Trust was founded in 2003 after Jane’s son, Sebastian, died at the age of 9 from a rare form of childhood cancer. Jane has known Sue since 2011 when they were introduced by Jo at the PM Advertising Awards. In 2015, Jane, Jo, Sue, Candida and Lesley trekked Iceland's Landmannalauger route, raising over £10,000 for the charity. Jane drove down from Berkshire to support Sue on Days 3 & 4 as she admires her tenacity and dedication to beating cancer. Jane feels enormously proud of both Sue and Jo for undertaking this awesome challenge and feels confident that Sue will complete it with Jo by her side."

On meeting Sue, Candida said that she was struck by her focus and infectious determination. Candida joined Sue's LEJOG team on Days 3 & 4 traveling through Somerset, Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, saying, \"I'm so pleased and proud to be able to support Sue in this small way as part of her huge cycling challenge to raise money and awareness for cancer research. This dreadful disease must be stamped out. I know that Sue will do amazingly well with her grit and determination, and with Jo by her side to support her the whole way.\""

  bio: "Chris and Michael, Jo's Mum and Dad, only met Sue in December 2015, although really do feel as though they have known her for years, as they have heard so much about her. Joining the 'dinner crew' on Day 3 in Axbridge, it was as part of Day 4's support team, driving to Tintern Abbey and onto Goodrich, that they witnessed the distance, sheer physical effort and the huge organisational task involved. Chris said, “We are very much in awe of the enormity of the challenge. We're following the route on a daily basis, Sue and Jo's efforts are very humbling, and we only wish we could be there to join them at John O'Groats at the finish. Sue's challenge is actually overshadowing the Rio 2016 Olympics!"
