  bio: 'Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars. Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’ Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and London to Paris cycle rides.'

  bio: 'Keen cyclist, Jonny, is accompanying Sue on the first three days of her challenge having completed LEJOG himself with wife Karen in 2010. One of Sue’s oldest friends, Sue and Jonny met forty years ago when Sue was a fresher at Newcastle University and Jonny was a local boy on the lookout! Jonny cycles 100-150 km a week and has not only kept Sue company on many of her training rides with Karen but has also helped with the practicalities of getting Sue’s bike and car ready for the trip. Jonny is keen to show his support for the valuable work that Sue does for CRUK and is looking forward to putting all their training into action on the challenging hills of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset.'
