  bio: >-
    Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is
    likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at
    the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite
    peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars.



    Jo and Sue first met through work about 15 years ago when Sue was
    a long-standing client of Jo and her husband Philip’s advertising agency,
    Langland. Breaking her own rule of not mixing business and pleasure, Jo’s
    friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of
    walking in the mountains, a good spreadsheet and ‘getting stuff done.’



    Jo has supported Sue on many of her previous challenges – on foot for Shine
    Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and in the support car for C2C and London to
    Paris.
