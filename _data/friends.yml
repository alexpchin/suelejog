  bio: "Keen cyclist, Jonny, will be accompanying Sue on the first three days of her challenge having completed LEJOG himself with wife Karen in 2010. \n\nOne of Sue’s oldest friends, Sue and Jonny met forty years ago when Sue was a fresher at Newcastle University and Jonny was a local boy on the lookout! \n\nJonny cycles 100-150 km a week and has not only kept Sue company on many of her training rides but has also helped with the practicalities of getting Sue’s bike and car ready for the trip.\n\nJonny is keen to show his support for the valuable work that Sue does for CRUK and is looking forward to putting all their training into action on the hills of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset."
