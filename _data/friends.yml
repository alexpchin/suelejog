  bio: 'Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars. Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’ Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and London to Paris cycle rides.'

  bio: 'Keen cyclist, Jonny, is accompanying Sue on the first three days of her challenge having completed LEJOG himself with wife Karen in 2010. One of Sue’s oldest friends, Sue and Jonny met forty years ago when Sue was a fresher at Newcastle University and Jonny was a local boy on the lookout! Jonny cycles 100-150 km a week and has not only kept Sue company on many of her training rides with Karen but has also helped with the practicalities of getting Sue’s bike and car ready for the trip. Jonny is keen to show his support for the valuable work that Sue does for CRUK and is looking forward to putting all their training into action on the challenging hills of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset.'

  bio: "As Fundraising Manager for Cancer Research UK, Tanisha has supported Sue in her many voluntary activities for the past year. After waving Sue off for Land’s End, Tanisha said, “Sue is an absolute inspiration. She has quite literally made supporting CRUK her life's work - not only lobbying government as an Ambassador but also finding time to undertake personal fundraising challenges like this one and raising the bar every time! Sue is passionate, ambitious and driven, and totally embodies the CRUK beliefs: Sharp minds and brave hearts win; United we are stronger than cancer; and Our stories change the world. Here's wishing Sue, and everyone supporting her on this epic trip, a wonderful and safe challenge.”"

  bio: 'Web development instructor and entrepreneur, Alex, has lent his support to Sue’s LEJOG challenge by building this website. Never one to do anything by halves, he answered Sue and Jo’s brief for a basic, template-driven blog with an extremely professional looking site, despite only being given an afternoon to put it together. With parents, Jo and Phil, Alex has also taken part in a couple of Sue’s adventures: walking a very wet Hadrian’s Wall in 2012 and joining them on a trekking holiday in the Dolomites in 2011. Alex has fond memories of playing golf at Frilford with Sue’s late husband Philip and is pleased to be able to help the indomitable “Barney” as she prepares for her biggest challenge yet!'
- name: Karen
  image: /assets/images/karen.jpg
  bio: 'Karen, Sue’s cycling companion for Day 3, met first Sue about 20 years ago, through her husband Jonny. She’s been cycling for 30 years, both on and off road, but says that her cycling has been transformed this year with a new bike - another Ruby! Over the years, Karen has done a lot of cycling and walking challenges with Sue. She says that Sue is always positive and motivated, and absolutely never complains, even when the going gets tough. On training rides with Sue and Jonny, Karen has gained a reputation for (mis)leading everyone down tracks and gravel paths. Having completed LEJOG in 2010, Karen’s was looking forward to this trip for the scenery and the camaraderie, but also to leaving all the route planning to someone else!'
- name: 'Kay & Richard'
  image: /assets/images/holmes family.jpg
  bio: 'Kay & Richard are two of Jo’s oldest and closest friends. They met Sue in 2015 when Sue, Jo, Jane and Candida stayed at their B&B in Lynmouth whilst training for their Icelandic trek. (The walk from Lynmouth to Coombe Martin along the north Devon coast turned out to be particularly arduous but the welcome that they all received at the Heatherville more than made up for it.) Kay & Richard, daughter Katherine, and grandchildren Noah and Lilah cheered Sue and Karen on as they passed through the Somerset village of Bishop’s Lydeard. Marvelling at Sue’s fitness and determination, Kay & Richard were also struck by how much Jo needed to do to keep the LEJOG show in the road!'
- name: Clem
  image: /assets/images/clem.jpg
  bio: 'Sue’s companion cyclist on Day 4, Clem has known Sue for just over 15 years. He has always been interested in cycling and, as a youth, cycled over 500 miles around Wales from Oxford in 5 days. Now in his 60s, he still likes to pull on the Lycra, completing the Coast to Coast cycle route with Sue in 2011; some of the stages of the Yorkshire Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014, and has also accompanied Sue her on a few of the training runs prior to LEJOG. Clem was also part of the ‘Inspirites’ team that completed Shine Manchester in 2010 and raised £18,000 in aid of Cancer Research UK. Clem wanted to show his support for Sue’s endeavour by riding alongside her on one of the stages.'
- name: Gill

  bio: 'Gill first met Sue at a friend’s party around the year 2000. In April 2010, she took part in the Manchester Shine overnight marathon walk with Sue, husband Clem and other friends, raising £18,000 for Cancer Research UK. Gill has also supported Sue in her Coast to Coast and London to Paris cycling challenges and enjoyed a cycling holiday in the Loire Valley with Sue and mutual friend Caroline. Gill was particularly keen to support Sue on her Land’s End to John O’Groats challenge because she thought that Sue needed "a little bit of help from her friends.” She is pleased to see so many people turning out to cheer Sue on, and thrilled that the challenge is raising so much money for a charity that’s also close to her heart.'
- name: Jane
  image: /assets/images/jane.jpg
  bio: "Jane is the CEO of Sebastian’s Action Trust, a charity that supports families of seriously ill children. The Trust was founded in 2003 after Jane’s son, Sebastian, died at the age of 9 from a rare form of childhood cancer. Jane has known Sue since 2011 when they were introduced by Jo at the PM Advertising Awards. In 2015, Jane, Jo, Sue, Candida and Lesley trekked Iceland's Landmannalauger route, raising over £10,000 for the charity. Jane drove down from Berkshire to support Sue on Days 3 & 4 as she admires her tenacity and dedication to beating cancer. Jane feels enormously proud of both Sue and Jo for undertaking this awesome challenge and feels confident that Sue will complete it with Jo by her side."

  bio: "Paediatric Oncology Nurse, Candida, met Sue just 18 months ago when the 'Iceland Five' started preparing for their trekking challenge in aid of Sebastian's Action Trust. On meeting Sue, Candida said that she was struck by her focus and infectious determination. Candida joined Sue's LEJOG support team on Days 3 & 4 traveling through Somerset, Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire, saying, \"I'm so pleased and proud to be able to support Sue in this small way as part of her huge cycling challenge to raise money and awareness for cancer research. This dreadful disease must be stamped out. I know that Sue will do amazingly well with her grit and determination, and with Jo by her side to support her the whole way.\""
- name: 'Chris & Michael'
  image: '/assets/images/mum & dad.jpg'
  bio: "Chris and Michael, Jo's Mum and Dad, only met Sue in December 2015, although really do feel as though they have known her for years, as they have heard so much about her. Joining the 'dinner crew' on Day 3 in Axbridge, it was as part of Day 4's support team, driving to Tintern Abbey and onto Goodrich, that they witnessed the distance, sheer physical effort and the huge organisational task involved. Chris said, “We are very much in awe of the enormity of the challenge. We're following the route on a daily basis, Sue and Jo's efforts are very humbling, and we only wish we could be there to join them at John O'Groats at the finish. Sue's challenge is actually overshadowing the Rio 2016 Olympics!"
- name: Patrick
  image: /assets/images/patrick.jpg
  bio: "A member of ‘Team Ambo,’ Patrick is a Cancer Campaigns Ambassador, Ambassador Aide and a member of the Ambassador Advisory Board. He has known Sue for two years through their shared work for Cancer Research UK. A keen runner and “charity jogger,” Patrick raised approximately £4,000 for CRUK by completing the London Marathon in 2014. He first joined the LEJOG support team in the West Country, where he was visiting his daughter and baby granddaughter, and returned a week later to represent ‘Team Ambo’ alongside Jo W in Scotland. Patrick said, “Sue is the most inspirational campaigner, fundraiser and volunteer for CRUK, so it's a huge pleasure and privilege to be able to support her on this epic challenge.”"
- name: Richard
  image: /assets/images/richard.jpg
  bio: 'Richard met Sue many years ago through Bayer. He says that it would be rude to say how long ago but suggests that maybe, ‘a significant while’ would do it. Arriving to meet the team at Tintern Abbey, Richard said: “Sue has earned the respect of everyone who loves and knows her - a tireless campaigner for CRUK. This epic journey, all 1011 miles from Land’s End to John O’Groats, demonstrates that sometimes actions are as important as words. Sue has humbled many of us in her commitment to a cause in which she truly believes — for oh so many reasons. Sue has literally ‘got on her bike’ so it seemed churlish not to get in the car for just a teeny-weeny part of her journey!'
- name: Rachel
  image: /assets/images/p1100362.jpg
  bio: "Philip's daughter, Rachel, joined Sue on her “absolutely amazing challenge” on Days 5 & 6. Although, by her own admission, not much of a sportswoman herself, Rachel does enjoy watching the ‘Lympics’ with her 2-year old twins, Harper and Tate. She came along as she wanted Sue to know that she has the full support of her family and friends and saw this as a good way of catching up with everyone. “Sue is courageous and determined, and is someone who believes in raising money and awareness for her cause. She is so passionate about the challenge that she will succeed. I think that Sue's zest for challenges will continue and maybe mass participation will be the way forward!\""
- name: Holly
  image: /assets/images/p1100360.jpg
  bio: "Holly, Sue’s cycling companion on Day 6, is Rachel's partner and has known Sue for nearly 5 years. She does a bit of running and cross fit and took part in the Nottingham Robin Hood half marathon last year. Holly also cycles about 18 miles a week to and from work and, in 2009, completed a London to Paris cycle ride to raise money for Kidney Research. She wanted to support the charity, as her little sister Tilly [now 32] was born with a kidney defect and, without valuable research, would definitely have had more complications. Holly wanted to ride part of the way with Sue to represent the family and “to make sure that somebody put in a bit of effort from our side!”"
- name: Elizabeth
  image: /assets/images/elizabeth.jpg
  bio: 'Elizabeth and Sue met at West Leeds Girls’ High School aged 11 and they have remained friends ever since. At school, they often found themselves together, as their surnames, Smith & Townend, were close in alphabetical order. Not a regular cyclist, Elizabeth’s 21-year old bike came out of the shed so that she could cycle the 64 miles with Sue on Day 6 of the challenge. After the day’s cycling, Elizabeth threw her house open to Sue, Jo and some of their supporters, and friend, Jeanie, cooked a delicious pasta supper for the team. When asked why she joined Sue on LEJOG, Elizabeth said that she thought Sue would be lonely but hadn’t realised that she would be chatting up all and sundry!'
- name: Cally

  bio: "Jo’s sister, Cally, has known Sue since 2010, when she was part of the 'Inspirites' team that completed Shine Manchester. A keen runner and always up for an adventure, she also supported Sue by taking on the hills of Hadrian Wall with family and friends in 2012. Cally said, “It was when I was doing Hadrian's Wall that I first noticed Sue's drive and determination, ploughing on up the hills through the rain, and motivating us all to finish the miles every day.” Part of the LEJOG back-up team on Days 5 & 6, Cally wanted to support Sue in this incredible challenge to recognise her tireless work to raise money for Cancer Research UK, as well as lending her support to her sister Jo along the way."
- name: Steve
  image: /assets/images/steve.jpg
  bio: "Steve met Sue nearly 30 years ago, when they worked together in the training department at Bayer. Showing his support on Day 6, Steve said, “Our careers weaved in and out of each other's, until I left Bayer and then our friendship really started to grow. Consequently, when it came to this latest challenge, it was the least I could do to offer some support, although I did feel guilty that it just involved sharing supper rather than putting in some hard miles on the bike. Having spoken to a number of people, who have done a LEJOG, I have only the greatest admiration for Sue's latest charity challenge. Her commitment to spreading the word about cancer prevention is something we should all be grateful for.”"
- name: Clive

  bio: 'Day 7’s accompanying cyclist, Clive, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in November 2003. Thanks to the NHS, CRUK and his early diagnosis, he is celebrating 13 years of being cancer free. Clive leads a very full and active life, completing the London, Rome, Berlin and New York marathons and other running events on behalf of CRUK. He is also a Cancer Campaigns Ambassador. When Sue asked for volunteers to accompany her on the LEJOG challenge, Clive wanted to come and support a common cause (in fact, he said that when Sue asks, no one ever says no!) Clive hopes that lots of people will sponsor him to help fund essential research and projects to help many more people to be as fortunate as he has been.'
- name: 'Chris & Ellie'
  image: /assets/images/p1100395 (1).jpg
  bio: "Sue's brother, Chris, surprised her by arriving with partner Ellie on Day 7 of the challenge. At first, Sue didn't realise who the two people holding the CRUK banner at the side of the road were, assuming that they were ‘randomers’ commandeered out of the pub by Jo to join the cheerleading squad. When asked why he'd 'crossed the line' from his native Yorkshire into Lancashire to support Sue, Chris said, \"As she battles with the physical side of her mammoth journey (and I really can’t believe some of those hills she went up), she needs to know that her family and friends are right behind her with every turn of the pedals. Turning up for one day was the least we could do. As always, I am very proud to be Sue’s little bruvver.\""
- name: 'Andy, Sue, Paula, Dave'
  image: '/assets/images/andy, sue, paula & dave.jpg'
  bio: "Sue met her “snowshoeing chums” in February 2014 on a fun-filled holiday in the Dolomites. Having had such a great time, eight of them exchanged contact details at Gatwick and have spent numerous weekends together since. Once, Sue slept in a caravan on Paula and Dave’s drive – they’d hired two caravans for the weekend to accommodate everyone – but was allowed into the house to perform her ablutions! The group all enjoy hiking and 'Tall Sue', Paula, Dave, Andy and 'Little Sue' are all going on a walking holiday in the Picos mountains  later this month. Not up to doing the cycling, Sue’s friends wanted to spur her on as they think that she’s “amazing, incredible and inspiring.”"
- name: 'Pam & Ken'
  image: '/assets/images/pam & ken.jpg'
  bio: 'Pam met Sue 40 years ago, when they were both students at Newcastle University. They met in halls and lived together in their 3rd year when Sue “gatecrashed” Pam’s flat. 25 years ago this September, Sue was bridesmaid at Pam & Ken’s wedding (her very fetching, emerald green dress is featured on the Day 8 blog). As well as showing their support through sponsorship, Pam & Ken drove the 20 miles from their home in Hayden Bridge to Brampton because “Sue told them to” and they wanted to come and see for themselves that LEJOG was really happening! They thought the challenge was “mad” but always knew that Sue would do it, as “mentally, she would never give in to anything.”'
- name: 'Lesley & Dave'
  image: '/assets/images/lesley & dave.jpg'
  bio: "Lesley met Sue almost 3 years ago, when they started working together in the Bayer Women's Health team. She’d planned to cycle a leg of Sue’s LEJOG but unfortunately couldn’t do so due to a last minute family commitment. Recognising Sue’s strength and determination in completing this amazing journey, Lesley wanted to show her support at some point. “To see Sue cycle into Brampton at the end of Day 8 filled me with complete awe, admiration and respect. She is truly amazing and I have no doubt she will be celebrating in John O’Groats, not only her personal achievement but also the phenomenal amount of money she will have raised for a cause that is very important and affects so many of us.”"
- name: Bryan
  image: /assets/images/bryan.jpg
  bio: 'Bryan has worked in the General Medicine division of Bayer for 22 years. He lives in the North East of England and accompanied Sue on Day 9 of the challenge. Unfortunately, Bryan was only able to cycle for half a day, as he had to get back to make the Sunday roast, but he had the pleasure of crossing the border into Scotland with Sue and fellow cyclist, Nigel. Bryan enjoys cycling holidays and has taken part in two of the Bayer charity rides – Newbury to Paris, with Sue, and London to Amsterdam. He has known Sue for a long time and knows that she’s very committed to everything she does. He wanted to show his support for Sue’s LEJOG by cycling part of the way with her.'
- name: Nigel
  image: /assets/images/nigel.jpg
  bio: 'Another friend from Bayer, Nigel said that he was led “amazingly” by Sue for a couple of years in Women’s Health. He accompanied Sue for part of Day 9 of the challenge – cycling from Brampton to Langholm in Dumfries & Galloway – and keeping her amused with his banter with Bryan. Nigel says that he’s not a natural cyclist and doesn’t get out of bed every morning thinking, “I must go on a bike ride.” He was, however, talked into the Bayer London to Amsterdam ride and went on to complete Amsterdam to Leverkusen last month. Nigel wanted to support Sue but also to raise money and awareness for CRUK, having lost his mum to stomach and oesophageal cancer 10 years ago at the age of 61.'
- name: Sue
  image: /assets/images/sue.jpg
  bio: "Fellow CRUK 'Ambo', Sue, came across Sue through viewing her brilliant ‘Science is Vital’ presentation online. She felt a strong connection, as she’d just contributed her own patient story to a report to MPs to encourage investment in science and found Sue’s ability to talk publicly about the loss of her husband Philip very moving and powerful. The ‘two Sues’ met in March this year on a training weekend. Cheering Sue’s on near her home in Edinburgh, Sue said, “I have huge respect for Sue's political campaigning and her fundraising efforts. She is very active on social media tweeting interesting facts and developments on cancer. Her work is vital to help more people avoid or overcome cancer and she is a fantastic inspiring role model.”"
- name: Jo W
  image: /assets/images/jo w.jpg
  bio: 'Fellow CRUK ‘Ambo’, Jo, first met Sue at a Parliamentary Day in 2014. He’d originally planned to cycle from Dollar to Grantown but once he’d committed, thought he might as well keep going to John O’Groats. A Scottish schoolboy international in athletics and rugby, cycling is now Jo’s main aerobic sport. He has been raising funds for cancer charities since 1993 and one of his most impressive sporting feats is the Monster Bike & Hike – a 30-mile cycle followed by a 42-mile walk! Speaking about Sue’s achievement, Jo said, “Everyone has already used all of the superlatives but unless you’ve done a LEJOG, you can never really appreciate how tough you need to be, both physically and mentally, to cope with the cumulative tiredness.”'

  image: '/assets/images/jock & linda.jpg'
  bio: 'Jock met Sue through her husband, Philip, who invited himself to join Jock’s golf group towards the end of 2006, and met Sue a while later. Although he only knew Philip for approx. 1,000 days, Jock says that he learned more from him in those 1,000 days than he’s learned from most people in a lifetime. Jock & Linda flew up to Scotland to support Sue on her LEJOG journey, combining this with a visit to family in Stornoway. They came because they “wanted to be there and to be part of it.” Jock said that the experience has been a humbling one and that the achievements of Sue and the other non-professional cyclists has blown him away. He never doubted, even on the down days, that Sue’s grittiness would carry her through.'
- name: Jackie
  image: /assets/images/jackie.jpg
  bio: "Jackie met Sue 11 years ago at Frilford Heath Golf Club. They were both working at the time, so their primary golf day was a Saturday and they played together regularly. In recent years, they have also enjoyed several golf holidays together. After traveling up to Scotland by train and bus, Jackie said, “Sue is a determined lady and, in my mind, she was always going to be successful with this challenging bike ride. I wanted to assist in any way I could, apart from getting on a bike myself! Sue invests a great deal of time in CRUK to the charity's benefit. She is a knowledgeable and naturally inquisitive person who is absolutely a \"great fit\" for a charity that wants to promote early diagnosis.”"

  bio: "‘Virtual friend’, Annie, really wanted to join her mum, Jo, and Sue (aka Barney) on part of their LEJOG journey (especially to witness their combined organisational skills)\_but due to work commitments had to settle for supporting them remotely by writing some of the Friends profiles. Annie was a member of the original 'Inspirites' team that walked Shine Manchester 2010, and also joined Sue, family and friends to scale the Hadrian’s Wall hills (made more manageable by singing very loudly!) She is inspired by Barney's ‘What are you waiting for?!' attitude, and immensely proud of her mum's dedication and support of her friend. Annie says that she’s always happy to support Barney with songs, blog posts or spreadsheets for whatever challenge she decides to tackle next!"
