  bio: "As Fundraising Manager for Cancer Research UK, Tanisha has supported Sue in her many voluntary activities for the past year. After waving her off, Tanisha said, \n\n“I’m so proud to be supporting Sue. She is an absolute inspiration. Sue has quite literally made supporting CRUK her life's work - not only lobbying government as a Campaign Ambassador but also finding time to undertake personal fundraising challenges like this one and raising the bar every time! \n\nSue is passionate, ambitious and driven, and totally embodies the CRUK beliefs: Sharp minds and brave hearts win; United we are stronger than cancer; and Our stories change the world.\n\nHere's wishing Sue, and everyone supporting her on this epic trip, a wonderful and safe challenge.”"

  bio: 'Web development instructor and entrepreneur, Alex, has lent his support to Sue’s LEJOG challenge by building this website. Never one to do anything by halves, he answered Sue and Jo’s brief for a basic, template-driven blog with an extremely professional looking site, despite only being given an afternoon to put it together. With parents, Jo and Phil, Alex has also taken part in a couple of Sue’s adventures: walking a very wet Hadrian’s Wall in 2012 and joining them on a trekking holiday in the Dolomites in 2011. Alex has fond memories of playing golf at Frilford with Sue’s late husband Philip and is pleased to be able to help the indomitable “Barney” as she prepares for her biggest challenge yet!'

    Jo will be driving the Support Vehicle throughout the entire challenge and is
    likely to be found organising logistics, or crouched over a camping stove at
    the side of a road, making sure that Sue has a mug of her favourite
    peppermint tea to wash down her protein bars.

















    Jo met Sue about 15 years ago when Sue was a client of Jo and husband
    Philip’s advertising agency, Langland. Jo’s friendship with Sue has developed
    over the years and they share a love of walking in the mountains, holidaying
    with friends and ‘getting stuff done.’

















    Jo has joined Sue on several of her previous challenges – walking Shine
    Manchester and Hadrian’s Wall and manning the support car for the C2C and
    London to Paris cycle rides.
