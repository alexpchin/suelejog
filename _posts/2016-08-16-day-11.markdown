Bruce woke me up at 6.15am on Day 11, so that I could get on and write my account of the previous day. As there was no Wi-Fi in my room, I had to stand on the landing, right next to the hotel’s router, to email the blog to Jo, Social Media Manager (and all round person-in-charge of this crazy two weeks). Whilst it was winging its way through the ether (or more accurately, through an internal wall), I flicked through an old guest book, looking at who had been in my room, number 5, in 1948.

Copy filed, I stayed near the router to check the route on my app and trace it onto my road atlas. By the end of the day, we would be on page 97. My morning admin tasks completed, I joined Jo in the restaurant for breakfast. Here we were joined by two of my Cancer Research UK Ambassador friends - Jo Williamson, accompanied by his partner, Liz, and Patrick. Jo has bravely offered to cycle with me for the remaining 5 days to John O'Groats and Patrick will assist Jo again with support.

Before setting off from the Tormaukin Inn, I was pleased to pass the baton onto Jo and we headed off in the beautiful Scottish sunshine towards our day's destination, just inside the Cairngorms National Park.

A few miles down the road, the mist had descended and this added to the beauty of the scenery. From the top of this hill, the road to our first stop was a very long downhill sweep - payback for the climb at the end of the previous day. I was feeling good!

En route we passed Gleneagles and my thought was that even a bad round of golf would be easier than another day in the saddle.

Because of the easy terrain, we reached our first stop at Kinkell Bridge sooner than anticipated. Jo was still in Auchterarder buying provisions for the day but Liz and Patrick were there to greet us. After a review of the next stage of the route to ensure that cyclists and supporters were clear on where to meet for lunch, we pedalled off.

This stage involved some inclines. Nothing too serious but at this point in the trip, even the slightest incline is painful on my thighs. The pain doesn't get any worse, it's just a question of how long I can put up with it, as I ascend the hills. We travelled over some stunning moorland, covered in beautiful, purple heather. Jo advised me that it would be even better next month but I will definitely not be returning with Ruby in September to check this out!

The temperature was rising, which meant that we needed to drink plenty of water to ensure that we remained hydrated. I don't like drinking whilst I'm on Ruby, as I'm clumsy enough without having any additional distractions, so we had to have frequent stops.

As we arrived in Stanley, we saw Jo's hallmark CRUK balloon and pulled up to have our picnic on a well-kept area of grass in the centre of the village. My lunch consisted of a large Brie and chutney roll (no longer Devon chutney as we've finished the 'never ending' jar), cake and flapjack. Scrumptious! Jo popped into the local pub to use the facilities and came back highly amused to have found potpourri in the urinals. When we asked what she was doing in the men's toilet, she explained that the urinals were in the ladies. Some ten minutes later, I went to see for myself. How very bizarre!

The picnic was very tasty, the company entertaining, and the sun relaxing. I didn't want to leave and had to be dragged back onto my feet by my Ambassador chums. I knew that we had to climb to more than 1,100ft at some stage, and was fearful of this with the state of my quads.

We cycled through relatively undulating countryside with cereal, carrots and potatoes growing in the fields. I did my best to maximise the momentum on the downhill bits to help get me up the other side and thus minimise the pain in my aching thighs. On one of our ascents, a fit, young thing cycled up rapidly behind us. He was very friendly and when he slowed down to chat to us, we engaged him in conversation. We learnt that he was Alfie George and that he was 15 years old. Alfie’s goal was to get into the Olympics, mine was to complete the day! When we Googled him that evening, we found that he was listed as a possible star of the future, and one of the “leading riders in the British National Youth Circuit Race Championships.” Mark Cavendish had been a previous winner. A really lovely young man, we wished him well as he accelerated away from us.

We cycled on through the little town of Blairgowrie (famous for raspberries) and with the benefit of Jo's local knowledge, we didn't get lost. As we were scooting down a hill, Jo pointed out the Cancer Research UK shop and I shouted, "Stop!" Jo thought there was a problem and screeched to a halt, only for me to explain that I wanted to go in and meet whoever was there and get a photo. Inside the shop, we found shop manager, Wendy, an American lady, who was lovely. We had a chat and Wendy explained that the shop in Blairgowrie is manned by a large number of Americans. She was interested in our roles as Ambassadors and so we told her that she could find details on the Cancer Research UK website. Wendy, if you're reading this and want further info, please email me and I'll put you in touch with your local man, Jo.

Our final stop was just beyond Blairgowrie. Jo had texted us to explain that the place we’d arranged to meet wasn’t suitable, so she was parked at the top of a hill on the other side of the town. It was further than we were anticipating but she promised extra cake for this. In addition to calorie-loading with copious amounts of cake, I also needed to replace my cleats (the attachments on my shoes, which clip me into my pedals). I'd put new ones on in Land’s End but had already worn parts of the plastic out and it was becoming more difficult to clip my shoes into the pedal. Knowing this, Liz and Patrick had gone into Perth after lunch to find a bike shop and had a brand new pair of cleats for me. This was when the fun began. Jonny had screwed them in so tightly in Land’s End that we (as in the Royal 'we') couldn't get the old ones out. Yesterday, I’d had help tightening my brakes from a man with a tool. Here I was now with two helpful men but with my stubby little Allen key they couldn't get enough leverage to loosen all the screws. Jo went and rummaged in his car and, with a larger tool, the two of them eventually achieved success.

Given that we were still not at any significant height; I knew that most of the climbing would be in last leg of the journey. I really wasn't looking forward to this. The sky was cloudless and the scenery absolutely beautiful but I was dreading the grind up to over 1,100 ft. Jo was a great support as we cycled along, setting an appropriate speed and using motivating language. There was nothing for it but to push through the pain. When my Garmin eventually showed an altitude of 1,134ft, I felt a huge sense of relief. The road from this point was undulating and then the last few miles to Spittal were downhill. Thank goodness, as my legs were absolutely spent. The cumulative effect of eleven days’ cycling has not yet produced the improved level of fitness that friends told me about - just thigh muscles that feel as though they've had enough.

We arrived at the Spittal of Glenshee and had photos taken in front of the burnt shell of a hotel that Jo, Liz and Patrick had planned to have coffee in whilst they were waiting for us! My legs felt heavy but my heart felt light, as we completed another day.

That evening, we had an enjoyable and amusing dinner at our hotel. At 10.30pm, we left Jo to update the web-site in the hotel bar, as she had no Wi-Fi in her room. She would probably be there until well after midnight. I collapsed into bed, anticipating, with some trepidation, the tomorrow’s ride over the Cairngorms ski area!
