After abandoning my packing last night in an attempt to get to bed by midnight, I woke this morning with a lengthy list of tasks to complete. As 'C' day had finally arrived, I felt rather more energised with the anticipation of the beginning of the big adventure. Jo and Phil Chin arrived at 9.20am and we began packing and branding the 'big bus' (VW Touareg). Whilst we were musing over how we would fit 5 people and all the gear into the boot at a later stage of the trip, I was surprised to see another car arrive and Tanisha, the Cancer Research UK Fundraising Manager for Oxfordshire, get out of it. Tanisha and Jo had been liaising secretly and she’d come to wish us well.

As we hugged, I burst into tears. I'd expected to feel like this at the end of the trip but not before we'd even started! I have been genuinely overwhelmed at how supportive people have been - financially, practically and emotionally. All these good wishes, kind words and encouragement mean so much to me.&nbsp;

Having pulled myself together, we completed the packing, picked Jonny up, and started our slow journey down the M4 and M5. As we travelled further south, I was focusing on the road ahead of me and noting that there were no 'flat bits'. That matched what the elevation profiles looked like for the first 3 days - hilly!&nbsp;

Having arrived at our accommodation, we offloaded much of the gear. However, perfectionist Jo wasn't happy that she didn't yet have a system for repacking the car to ensure that items we required during the day were easily available. She is gradually formulating a plan, which I'm sure will be as efficient as everything else she's ever come into contact with!

We dumped the bags and the bikes in our rooms and re-grouped in the bar to 'do our colouring in'.

Whilst we’re using Garmin devices for navigation, we'd identified that we needed a contingency plan in case the technology failed. Consequently, some weeks ago, I bought a couple of large road atlases in which we could highlight the route, so that both Jo and I could revert to old fashioned methods if necessary. From a communication perspective, we also recognised that we could be stuck in an emergency if we didn't have O2 network coverage for our iPhones. We therefore decided to purchase a couple of very basic pay-as-you-go Nokia phones from Vodaphone. There was some amusement at dinner as we tried to cast our minds back to the old days and remember out how to use them!

With those tasks complete, we had dinner watching the sun set over the southernmost point of the country and then abandoned the world in preparation for Day 1....
