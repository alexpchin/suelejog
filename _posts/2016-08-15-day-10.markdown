I woke up to our first 'double digit' day - Day 10 – and my first action was to check how effective the heated towel rail had been at drying my cycling clothes. The good news was that all items were dry enough to wear; the bad news was that I dropped a pair of cycling shorts down the toilet as I took the items off the rail. Positioning the towel rail immediately above the toilet is just asking for trouble!

Having written the blog for the previous day, I tried to email it to Jo but to no avail - the system was down and remained down for the rest of the morning. Hotel Wi-Fi is now firmly in my Room 101. We've had issues everywhere we've stayed (other than at school chum, Elizabeth's, house), which has been very frustrating.

The other task I wanted to use the internet for was to identify bike shops in the local area. My front brake needed adjusting but it was rather more than finger tight and wouldn't budge. Jo and I loaded Ruby onto the car and set off to [bspoke cycles](http://www.bspokepeebles.co.uk/).

With the right tool, the helpful man in the bike shop resolved my issue within a couple of minutes, whilst Jo took the opportunity to buy picnic supplies for the day. We then reloaded Ruby onto the car and Jo drove me back to the point where I finished yesterday.

A late start (again) but the sun was shining and I was feeling positive. I set off and cycled through the attractive, little town of Peebles, located on the banks of the River Tweed.&nbsp;

As I pedalled down the High Street, I screeched to a halt when I spotted the Cancer Research UK shop. I went inside and met today's blog-pal, Margaret, the shop manager and one of her volunteers. She was a lovely lady, who told me about the time she walked the 98 miles of the West Highland Way (something that’s already on my bucket list). We had our photo taken outside the shop – a feat which took four attempts by two different people - and I left promising to email her the photo and the link to our blog.&nbsp;

I left Peebles on the A703 heading north towards Edinburgh. This road surface wins 'poor surface of the day,' as it had chippings projecting significantly from the Tarmac surface. This may be great for cars when conditions are icy in January but absolutely dreadful for cyclists when it’s dry and the temperature is 21 degrees in the summer. The ride was hard, uncomfortable work and I feared for Ruby's tyres. Even the scenery provided little consolation.

I was pleased to see Jo's hallmark, Cancer Research UK balloon, flying from the car at the side of the road after about 18 miles - time for a Danish pastry and to use the 'facilities' in the adjacent field.&nbsp;

Our next planned stop was in South Queensferry, just south of the Forth river but before then I had to navigate through the outskirts of Edinburgh. Towns are never easy with the Garmin and I took a whole load of wrong turns. However, my spirits were high, with the sun shining and the anticipation of cycling over the Forth Road Bridge. As I stopped at a set of traffic lights, the car next to me had Queen playing "I want to ride my bicycle.” How very apt. A couple of miles further on, I saw a sign to Leith, which made me think of the Proclaimers and I sang, "And I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more" loudly and in a Scottish accent, as I pedalled through the traffic. No-one could hear me and I didn't care anyway!&nbsp;

Whilst still on the B701, the old Edinburgh bypass, I spotted a large Cancer Research UK banner at the side of the road ahead.

I pulled up and Jo was there with Sue, the Cancer Research UK Ambassador, for the area. How lovely of her to come and cheer me on with her cousin, Sue. (Is there a collective noun for a group of Sues?) We sat in the garden of her local pub and I enjoyed a half of lime and soda as we chatted. Thank you for your support and motivation, Sue. It means a lot!&nbsp;

After a welcome break, I pressed on and came across another of my Room 101's - vehicles parking in cycle lanes. Carpenter, D Harrison, I was not impressed.&nbsp;

I reached South Queensferry and was in my element. I love a good bridge and the Forth Rail Bridge is one of the most iconic in the world. We sat and had lunch in the garden of Harry Ramsden's, which was in a fantastic location overlooking the Forth and the three bridges - rail, road and the new bridge, which is not yet completed. There was a sign, which made it clear that parking in the car park was strictly for customers only, so Jo had some chips for the team! I didn't want to leave here, as the view and the weather were great but it was already late in the afternoon, as we'd spent a lot of time chatting and admiring the scenery, so we needed to push on.&nbsp;

However, we couldn’t leave before having a photo with the iconic red bridge. There was a group of Chinese tourists on the promenade, snapping hundreds of photographs of the bridge, themselves and anything else that moved. The poses that they were striking were quite ridiculous and Jo and I looked on with amusement. Then, just as we were about to go, the young man in the group, Bruce, asked if one of the girls could have a photo with me. I obliged and the rest of the party then lined up to have their photos taken with the lady on the bike. Jo and I were in hysterics!&nbsp;

Photoshoot over, I left Jo and cycled on to find the cycle route over the Forth Road Bridge. It was commuter time by now and there was a queue of cars waiting to get over the bridge. Thankfully, bikes could go down the bus lane, so I merrily scooted past them feeling excited and full of anticipation. I rode through a subway to the other side of the bridge and onto the cycle lane. On such a beautiful day, the experience was fantastic and I felt elated. My third attempt at a selfie - slightly improved from the one on the Severn Bridge but still not great – how does Kim Kardashian do it?&nbsp;

Having crossed the river, the route I needed to take next was not really clear. I stopped and got my iPhone out to identify which road I was on and then worked out which way to go from the pages ripped out of the road atlas. The route to meet Jo at our final stop was not scenic and I was beginning to get an uncomfortable rear. The miles passed slowly. I was pleased to see the CRUK balloon again at the side of the road and appreciated the mug of peppermint tea and assorted cake. However, this was definitely the low point of the day. With about 16 miles left to cycle, I didn't want to leave the comfort of the roadside stop.

Jo recounted the story of visiting a nearby shop, where she couldn't understand the man with a strong accent, and where the bottles of water were labelled with '0 calories.’ Her ridiculous attempt at a Scottish accent and the label on the water amused me, and were both laughing hysterically again.&nbsp;

Having left the pit stop, the final miles were hard work. It was made worse by the reappearance of the poor road surface I'd experienced earlier in the day. This was not what I needed. The positive thing was that the soft golden light of the evening sun enhanced the beauty of the landscape. With about 5 miles left to run, I stopped to take a photo of the River Devon. This was really just an excuse to get off my bike, as there was a slight hill ahead of me and I was fading fast.&nbsp;

I arrived at our accommodation, where Ruby was put to bed in the wine store, and Jo and I worked out who was going to have which room. One room had a bath and good Wi-Fi, the other room had a shower and no Wi-Fi. I always take any room with a bath but Jo needs Wi-Fi more than I do for her work on the web-site. We decided that I'd have a bath, she'd have a shower, and then we'd switch rooms!

At supper that evening, we had another bout of hysteria as we remembered the Chinese tourists and the zero calorie bottles of water. Tiredness seems to exacerbate hysteria and we've had much of both on this trip. Day 10 is complete and we were pleased to have reached page 90 of the road atlas. Onwards and upwards, John O’Groats here we come…..

(Editor's note to all the amazing cyclists who have accompanied Sue and to Sue's friends and family who have supported us along the way - there's a technical issue with the Friends gallery but Alex, our webmaster, is on the case and I will upload your profiles as soon as I am able to)
