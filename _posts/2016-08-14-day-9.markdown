When I woke up this morning, I had two concerns. Firstly, how was I going to get my clothes dry for the day and secondly, what state was my rear going to be in when I had no Chamois cream for the second consecutive day.&nbsp;

The towel rail in my room the previous evening wasn’t heated and my hairdryer had not been that effective at drying my Cancer Research UK top. (Yes, I do wear the same one every day). Also, I’d been lazy the night before last and not washed my bottoms, so had no clean, dry, pair to wear. Another session with the hairdryer in the morning did not produce dry enough garments to wear. Thankfully, when I went downstairs, one of the staff resolved my issue by showing me where the tumble dryer was. Relief!&nbsp;

Cyclists amongst you will know 'Chammy' cream well. It's meant to reduce friction between the saddle and the parts which are in contact with it. I'd left my pot behind in Kirkby Lonsdale. &nbsp;

Whilst we were eating breakfast, our cyclists for the day, Nigel and Bryan (friends from Bayer) arrived. We'd agreed to meet-up at 9.30am but they obviously hadn't forgotten my intolerance for a lack of punctuality in the workplace, and so were with us before 9.15am. My second issue was soon resolved as Bryan had a part-used tub of ‘Chammy’ cream and donated it to the cause. In an ideal world, this probably isn't the sort of product to share but needs must!&nbsp;

Cream applied, I was ready to hand the baton to the chaps and do the photos. Jo was initially concerned that the background wasn't great but we decided that the blog should feature warts and all rather than just beautiful locations.&nbsp;

With the photo done, we pedalled off. With both my initial concerns resolved, I could go on to worrying about the day ahead!

The boys are both stronger cyclists than I am. They cycled slightly slower than normal and I pushed on rather more quickly than I do when I’m by myself. The lanes we were on allowed for us to chat along the way and I was entertained by the banter between the two of them.&nbsp;

Our only issue before our first stop was a herd of cows in the road, which were being herded by a very effective sheepdog.&nbsp;

The first stop was in the valley of Liddel Water, which marked the border with Scotland. This was a landmark stop for me. I'd been cycling for the last 9 days and this made me feel that we'd made significant progress.&nbsp;

Jo was waiting for us with peppermint tea and a choice of cakes. I opted for a slice of ginger cake and a piece of coconut and cherry flapjack. (Thanks Pam for the flapjack.) The boys were impressed by Jo's service.&nbsp;

Twenty-five miles on was our next stop at Langholm. &nbsp;We ate ice creams in a car park by the river and Jo made some Cheddar cheese sandwiches with the popular and everlasting Devon chutney that was purchased a week ago in Boscastle. Last Sunday seems a long time ago in the time warp that is LEJOG.&nbsp;

It was here that we met our first blog-pals of the day. Kevin and Steve were out with their partners for a day on big beasts. They kindly let me sit on one of their bikes. I mused over how quickly I could get to John O'Groats on this and also how comfortable the seat was.&nbsp;

With sandwiches and photos finished, I said goodbye to Nigel and Bryan, as they had to cycle back to Brampton to pick up their car and get back to Newcastle for their Sunday roasts. I started pedaling up the hill and, after about 5 miles, I got a wave from a couple of motor-bikes as they overtook me. It was Kevin and Steve.&nbsp;

My next meeting with Jo would be at the Samye Ling Monastery & Tibetan Centre near Eskdalemuir - just over half way on today's journey. The ride was a beautiful one, which generally followed the River Esk. As I pushed further on, the landscape became more remote with bracken and coniferous plantations, occasionally dotted with farm buildings.&nbsp;

The Tibetan Centre was much bigger than I'd expected, with many buildings for the community that lived there. I followed signs and eventually found Jo in the tea rooms. Whilst we were ordering a bowl of vegetable soup, we got speaking to a lovely lady, Helen, and her partner, Gareth. Gareth started worked in Pharma at the time I did and now trains both the NHS and Pharma on clinical studies. Helen explained that her mum had very recently been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. Sadly this was already at a late stage, as her GP had ignored the symptoms that her mum had presented with earlier. Thank you for looking at our blog Helen and for your sponsorship.&nbsp;

We stayed rather longer in the Tibetan Centre than planned. Helen and Gareth were lovely to chat to, and I was also delaying getting on my bike by an older couple who started chatting to us. They were there with their grandson, Emerson. The lady, Zena, explained that she'd been treated for breast cancer 30 years ago. Here was obviously a much more positive story of early diagnosis. We were quite moved when, after only chatting to them for only a few minutes, young Emerson handed us a &pound;20 note in sponsorship.

So, more blog-pals than normal today, as we met too many lovely people to make decisions about who is featured.&nbsp;

The next and final stop of the day was the Tushielaw Inn, a two hundred-year old coaching inn in the Ettrick Valley. The journey to reach it was beautiful and remote and when I stopped at the side of the road to use the 'facilities' (a forest) I realised that there was absolutely no noise at all. The route involved a gradual climb and a satisfying long downhill. Once I arrived, I was treated to another of Jo’s roadside picnics - peppermint tea, carrot cake and flapjack. and then we pressed on to our destination, which was a few miles before Peebles.&nbsp;

This last 16 miles involved two climbs. They weren't steep, but were long. Whilst the scenery continued to engage me with its beauty, I'd have gladly given up the view to be at our accommodation! At a low point, I stopped, got my phone out and looked at a couple of photos to inspire me. That helped and I pushed on. The highlight of the day was when I reached the highest point of the day at approx. 1,300ft. The view was fantastic and even better - I knew from here it was approximately 6 miles to where we were staying, and all downhill.&nbsp;

I arrived at our hotel feeling very tired and with a rear that felt battered from having been in the saddle for 9 days. The positive thing about tonight’s accommodation was that my room had a bath. Within 5 minutes of arriving, I got into the bath and promptly fell asleep. When I woke up it was time to join Jo for supper, where we discussed the day, caught up with social media and reviewed our plans for the following days. Before long, we were both in bed and dreaming of another day in LEJOG land....
