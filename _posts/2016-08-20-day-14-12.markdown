Bruce woke me at 6am to write the blog for the previous day, which I set about doing once I'd checked that the heated towel rail had dried my Cancer Research UK cycling top. My routine of getting the blog to Jo by midnight on the day of the ride, so that she could edit my copy, select photos and upload everything before going to bed, had lapsed more than a week ago. I'm more efficient in the morning than in the evenings and so writing at 6am has become part of the routine.&nbsp;

Blog completed, it was on with the next tasks. The previous day, a blood transfusion, dose of EPO and a ton of steroids had increased my cycling efficiency and strength, so I adopted the same regime again. Or rather, I was relying on daily doses of Nurofen, so I took a couple prophylactically. I’m pleased that the only parts of me that have experienced problems over the last two weeks are my thighs (which I've banged on about in most blogs) and my rear, which is fed up with the rough road surfaces that seem particularly prevalent in Scotland. A reduction in the natural padding, during my pre-LEJOG training, probably hasn't helped with this.&nbsp;

I had breakfast with the gang and spirits were high. Texts and Facebook messages kept pinging through with words of support and encouragement, which really motivated me. Outside, it was drizzling slightly and quite misty but cyclist Jo and I were keen to get off.

So, for the first time since Land’s End, I donned my waterproof jacket, as I prepared Rubes for the final leg. Having become intimately acquainted with her over the last two weeks, I now feel that Ruby is rather too formal a name for my trusted bike.

We hugged our supporters, posed for the final 'setting off' photo and then pedalled off into the mist.

By the time we reached the top of the first hill, the drizzle had stopped and I’d warmed up, so off came the waterproof jacket. We pushed on and I could see the eerie shape of the Dounreay nuclear power station in the distance. The countryside we were cycling through wasn't attractive and the properties we saw along the way were pebble-dashed and painted in drab grey and dirty beige. I wasn't sure if it was the weather that created these aesthetically unappealing surroundings or if it was just downright ugly in the sunshine too.&nbsp;

After 13 miles, we had a brief stop with the team. I ate an unnecessary treacle and oatmeal biscuit and then, without much further ado, we continued cycling.

Whilst the wind was not as strong as yesterday, it was still significantly impeding our progress. Jo was a brick and continued cycling at the front to protect me. I did ask, at one point, if he would like me to take the lead and was absolutely delighted when he said no. I tucked in behind him with my head down, focusing on his rear wheel and the cuts on his right calf, which were inflicted by his bike during a fall a few days earlier. For the first time in this trip, I wasn't interested in the scenery. We pushed on at a fair pace and reached our final planned stop just 12 miles further on. Our support team were in good form, cheering us enthusiastically. We accepted a warming cup of hot chocolate and more unnecessary cake and Social Media Manager Jo insisted on taking more photos, as this would be the last opportunity before the finish. As we were about to leave, two other LEJOGers came hurtling along the road. They were “the boys” Pete and Roy, whom the support team had encountered and plied with cake at The Crask Inn yesterday. Pete and Roy were completing the challenge to raise money for Sarcoma UK in memory of their friend, trumpet player Derek Watkins. We exchanged congratulatory comments on nearly reaching John O'Groats and, after whipping off our jackets to ensure that our respective charity tops were clearly visible, posed for a photograph together. My cry of, "Get your branding out" had been a regular feature of the last two weeks - once a marketeer, always a marketer!

It struck me, as we prepared to leave, what this was all about – raising money and awareness to beat this dreadful disease that has claimed so many of our friends and loved ones. With a supportive push from the team, we set off to our final destination with less than 13 miles to go.

My Garmin was set to show the distance to destination and I watched the number of miles reduce. Jo continued to protect me from the wind and I kept my head down, pedalling hard. Every few miles, I called out to Jo, announcing the distance to the finish at John O’Groats. As I shouted, "Three miles left to go," I found myself welling up and this converted to tears rolling down my face for the next mile and a half. It was a real mix of emotions: satisfaction, that I'd almost completed the challenge; sadness at the thought of Philip and Mum who hadn't beaten cancer; and appreciation for all the lovely friends and family who'd supported me.&nbsp;

With only a mile left to cycle, I managed to pull myself together. We turned left at the final road junction and headed down the home straight towards the finish.

As we came into view of our supporters, they clapped and shouted even more wildly than they done previously and I was moved by the sight of six Bruce Springsteens behind a specially prepared congratulatory banner and 'Glory Days' playing on an iPhone. (I later learned that Chinny had brought the banner up on the plane, as Jo dare not have it in the car in case I discovered it!) For the past two weeks, I’d been joking that as Jo had sorted everything else, including springing some surprise guests on me, I was sure she'd arrange for my musical hero, Springsteen, to greet me at the end (probably without the E Street Band as that would have been too complicated). She didn’t disappoint!

More tears flowed, as the emotion of this epic challenge spilled out and I had huge hugs with cycling Jo, logistics Jo and all the other members of the gang that had made the long trip up to Scotland to support me.

With the hugging completed and tears wiped away, we headed to the official signpost for more photos. These were a bit like wedding photos, as we posed for numerous variations with different combinations of people.

Then it was time for coffees all round in a modern caf&eacute; called the Storehouse - the only reasonably tasteful looking place in the dump that is John O'Groats. As we were celebrating, we saw Pete and Roy cycle in after their detour to Dunnet Head. Jo rushed out to take the obligatory finish photo, as they didn’t have any supporters with them, and then they joined us at our wooden refectory table for coffee and more hugs.

Warm, contented and relaxed in the company of good friends, the time passed quickly and, having arrived at John O’Groats at 1.10pm, it was now 3.15pm. We said our goodbyes to “the boys” and headed off, as we had a three-hour drive back down to the Cairngorms and our hotel for the night. By now the sun had come out and after sleeping for the first 45 minutes in the car, I got the road atlas out and retraced some of the route I'd taken on Rubes in reverse order - the Dornach Firth, Cromarty Firth and Moray Firth. It seemed a long way as we travelled the 149 miles in the car. The journey which took two and a half days on Rubes took just three hours in the car. It was a more direct route but the road was nowhere near as pretty as the tracks that Jo and I had cycled along.

I'd reached page 112 of the road atlas having started, at the beginning of my journey, on page 2. It felt as though I'd been in the LEJOG world for months rather than just two weeks and I'm oblivious to what's been happening outside my LEJOG bubble, as this has been my complete focus for the last 15 days. I'd worn my Cancer Research UK top with pride and felt that this had given me permission to ask for anything from anyone (particularly useful when I’ve needed to use the facilities!) Everyone we’ve met has been so supportive and no-one has refused any request I've made of them.&nbsp;

In an early blog, I mentioned that it wasn't just the destination that was important to me but the journey. And what a journey it's been! A journey filled with highs and lows, beautiful scenery and varying emotions but most of all brilliant people. There’s no way I could have done this without the incredible support I've received.

So, as I reflect back on my astonishing LEJOG experience, my huge thanks go out to:

* Jo, my constant companion, who's been absolutely awesome (and I don't usually use that word). Anyone who's been with us on the trip has appreciated how much she's done as Logistics Manager, Social Media Manager, Training Manager (for other members of the support team), 'Dealing with Emergencies Manager' and Manager of anything else that's been required. She's survived on ridiculously little sleep over the last two weeks to make sure that the website was updated as we went along and her contribution to this whole adventure has been absolutely outstanding.&nbsp;
* All those who've cycled with me, borrowing bikes or getting them out of hibernation, to be able to join me. A special mention goes to Jo, who rode with me for the last 5 days as pacemaker, encourager and all round brilliant friend.
* All those who've come along to support us during the day or joined us for dinner. Your involvement and camaraderie has been so enjoyable and even when I've been flagging at dinner after a heavy day, I've loved having you there.
* Everyone who's provided motivation through text messages, Facebook and Twitter - I've really enjoyed reading them and they've spurred me on to complete the task.
* Rubes, who has stood up well to some hard work over the last two weeks.
* Everyone who's sponsored me. The current total is &pound;7,820.97 (and I’m really hoping that this will increase to &pound;10,000.) Your generosity really will help Cancer Research UK achieve its goal of Beating Cancer Sooner.
* Philip, who inspired me during his life with his "What are you waiting for?!" approach and who continues to inspire me, even though he's no longer around.
* Patrick whose support has been particularly appreciated and whose love has made me realise that my already fulfilled, happy life, surrounded by friends and family, can be even happier.
