The sound of Bruce Springsteen playing Promised Land woke me at 6.15am. Sadly, it was my alarm going off, so I jumped up and got on with the 'stuff' that needs to be prepared as part of the morning routine. This includes tracing the route from MapMyRide onto my copy of the road atlas for contingency purposes. Jo then 'copies my homework' into her atlas over breakfast and we decide where the support stops should be. With all this to do, there was little time to worry about the dreaded Day 3.&nbsp;

Jonny, who had cycled the first 2 days with me had aggravated an existing knee problem and consequently his wife Karen had driven down last night to replace him. With the baton well and truly passed over to the all-girl team, we got ready and set off for what looked, on paper, to be a gruelling day.&nbsp;

The route to the first stop at South Molton was uneventful and the weather was reasonably kind to us despite a chilly start. I was not, however, looking forward to the next stage of our journey - the ascent onto Exmoor, where we needed to climb to almost 1,400ft. Fuelled up with a Danish pastry from the Support Vehicle, we pressed on. After a short distance, we turned off the main road and ascended reasonably steeply. Tall hedges on either side of the narrow road blocked our view as we climbed towards the moor. The climb was relatively long but thankfully the gradient reduced as we got higher up. The good news was that we were still reasonably fresh. After some time, we were greeted by sheep baaing their recognition as we reached the summit and we decided that we needed to capture our triumph with a selfie. Taking selfies, however, is clearly not a skill of mine!

The next part of the route was a fantastic, sweeping downhill road across the bleak moorland. In the distance was the light green of pasture and dark green woods. I was pleased that the weather was kind to us, as cycling across the moorland in the pouring rain or mist would be a very different experience.&nbsp;

Our pleasurable descent brought us to the pretty village of Withypool, which was snuggled in the bottom of the valley.

A quick stop for a photo and then back in the saddle again where we had a 20% ascent out of the village. This hill won the award for the “bastard (pronounce with short northern 'a' rather than long southern 'a') hill of the day'. Karen and I puffed and grunted like voiceovers in a porn movie, as we struggled upwards. No pleasure for us, only pain!&nbsp;

Another downhill section took us to our lunch stop at Winsford, where we easily spotted Jo's landmark Cancer Research UK balloon tied to a lamppost or road sign to denote where she is. We had our Day 3 picnic in this attractive village and exchanged stories of the morning. Jo had apparently been given donations by a lady called Marion and, somewhat bizarrely, by a man called Dave, who was dressed as a rhinoceros!&nbsp;

Once again, the only way out of the village was up. It was all becoming rather predictable and increasingly challenging as the day progressed. The low spot of the day was when I realised that it had been 5 hours since we started off and we hadn't quite completed 50% of the route. I was feeling rather despondent and doing calculations as to the time we'd arrive at Draycott. All rather depressing!&nbsp;

The high spot happened 5 minutes later. As soon as we hit the half way point the bushes to our left stopped and we were rewarded with a fantastic view down to the Bristol Channel, across to Wales and the Island of Lundy. Our spirits lifted.

Even better, we then had a gradual descent of about 1,000ft to our afternoon break in the pretty village of Bishops Lydeard, where the buildings were made from brown Somerset sandstone. As we cycled into the village, we were greeted by our very own welcome party - Jo's friends Kay & Richard, daughter Katherine and two of their grandchildren, holding the Cancer Research UK banner and waving balloons. This brings me to our blog-pal of the day. Jo's rhinoceros was an initial contender but he was displaced by 4-year-old Noah who was chief balloon waver. A very worthy winner.&nbsp;

The final slog up through the Quantocks required us to dig deep. If this had been earlier in the day, it would have been acceptable but by this stage 2 'Ridgeways' was a lot to deal with. The positive thing was that we were cycling in dappled shade, as we climbed through the woods. We had a celebratory "Yay!" at the top, as there were no more significant hills to climb on today’s route.&nbsp;

With 20 miles to go, we were now cycling across the flat lands of the Somerset levels. By this time, we were keen to get the ride completed and cycled like mad women to achieve this end. All I could think of was to keep the momentum going to be as efficient and speedy as possible. I'm not sure where this energy came from as I felt quite depleted. We pushed on and on and eventually reached the village of Draycott where we phoned Jo and then literally collapsed on the grass.&nbsp;

When we arrived at our accommodation in Axbridge, we were greeted by several friends who'd traveled some distance, from Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Weston Super Mare, to join us for dinner. They also provided a good porter and laundry service at the end of an exhausting day!

A very big day out and my thought right now is, “How can I get back on my bike tomorrow, with thighs that feel like lead and a rear that has had enough of being in the saddle?!” However, tomorrow is another day and with 6 supporters for 3 cyclists, we should be very well looked after!
