As I woke up to Day 6, I realised that I'd had a dream about Ruby. The only thing I could remember was that one of her wheels was missing a spoke. In my semi-conscious state, I decided that it was only one spoke, so I'd ignore it and cycle on. It was completely ridiculous that I was dreaming about Ruby but just as ridiculous that I was prepared to cycle when she wasn't in full working order.

I got up and on with the routine of tracing today's route in the road atlas, feeling pleased that by the end of the day we'd be on page 55. Our new team of Rachel, Holly, Elizabeth and Cally, arrived at breakfast, excited to be involved in LEJOG and keen to get moving. I was happy to pass the baton onto my two new companions today, after my solo cycle yesterday. As this was the first day we were cycling directly from our accommodation, our plan was to start cycling earlier than previous days, at 9.15am. We agreed that the first stop would be Little Wenlock, which was at the top of the day's most significant hill, and congregated in the car park bright and early to pack the three support vehicles.

As I did my check of Ruby, to my horror, I saw that she'd got a huge injury to her rear tyre. All those beautiful but rutted and gravelly single track roads had taken their toll.

My emotions at this stage were panic and despair. I know a plan is meant to be flexible and adaptable but I'd hoped to get off to an earlier start today. This would have resulted in an earlier finish and an opportunity to get a good night’s sleep, as we’ve been averaging less than 6 hours over the past week. I took the offending wheel off, as I had a spare wheel that had been kindly loaned by my friend Jackie but not the tool that was needed to get the gear off my wheel and onto the new wheel.

Support and Logistics Manager and general hero, Jo, got onto t’internet and located a bike business on an industrial estate in Telford (approx.. 30 mins away). She spoke to a man called Dale, who was the owner and solo worker in the business but he was out on the road visiting suppliers. Hearing our plight, he agreed to drive back to his workshop and meet us there in 40 minutes. We packed all three bikes into the back of Rachel's car, separated by various blankets and rucksacks to ensure they didn't damage each other, and the cyclists accompanied them to Telford in one of the other support vehicles. Jo and Cally went off to buy the day's provisions and we agreed to meet in Little Wenlock.

We arrived at Dale's unit and waited for 10 minutes until he arrived. In the interim, to pass the time, we sat in the back of Rachel's car and played a game of guessing what Dale would look like. None of us had expected the larger-than-life character who arrived, and was so helpful and kind. He replaced both tyres for me with considerable speed, whilst his assistant Tyke the dog, looked on. When I asked how much I owed him, he absolutely refused to take any payment, as the ride was for a cancer charity. I discovered that the cost for the tyres themselves would have been &pound;40, so said that I would put that amount into the sponsorship pot as a donation from him. We had a hug and a photo and decided that Dale would definitely be blog-pal of the day. After all that he had done for us, we couldn't imagine that anyone could oust him from this position.

So, two hours behind schedule, we were ready to take the starting photos in Little Wenlock, and I was pleased to pass the baton on to Holly and Elizabeth.&nbsp;

Whilst sorting out the bike issues, we'd made the decision to miss out the first 9 miles of the route, and begin our cycling in Little Wenlock, so that we didn't have to drive back to Much Wenlock. This wasn't an easy decision but I desperately want to ‘join the dots’ so I'll be doing this small section of the route on Tuesday 23rd August.&nbsp;

We climbed to the highest point of the day within about half an hour and had the benefit of an enjoyable downhill sweep afterwards.&nbsp;

The landscape was much flatter today, which was helpful after the grinding of previous days. The undulations were more gentle and allowed us to maximise speed on the downhill bits and gain the momentum to carry us upwards. At the top of a hill, we'd shout “momentum”, pedal like fury in a high gear, and see how far we could make it on the uphill.&nbsp;

My account of the cycling and landscape is somewhat shorter today, not because it wasn't enjoyable but due to the limited time I had to write this blog! I was too tired to complete it on last night, failed to wake up when my alarm went off at 6.30am, and then had time pressure to get on the road to meet today's cycling, companion Clive.&nbsp;

In summary, the route varied from single track roads through golden fields, where the crops had been recently harvested, to busy A roads passing through, or bypassing towns, such as Nantwich, Middlewich and Northwich. Supporter Patrick advised yesterday that the 'wich' apparently denotes it was a Cheshire salt town.&nbsp;

Due to our late start, we’d only covered 25 miles when Holly and Rachel had to leave us to return to Nottingham to pick up their adorable twins, Harper and Tate (age 2.75 years), from nursery. This was a shame, and probably a little frustrating, for Holly, who'd borrowed 'Crazy Wendy's' road bike to do the trip. After they left, school chum, Elizabeth and I, cycled on together and made sure that we caught up on the latest gossip and events, as we hadn't seen each other for a couple of months. Elizabeth took the lead for parts of the ride, as she had some suggestions on improvements to the route based on her local knowledge. I was motivated by cycling behind her Cancer Research UK t-shirt.&nbsp;

Whilst there weren’t any great elevation changes today, the day was very tiring due to the headwind and the cumulative effects of the previous five days on my rear. The low point came with about 22 miles to go, where fellow CRUK Ambassador, Patrick, gave us appropriate motivating words.&nbsp;

We reached our destination before Jo and Cally, as we'd pedalled quicker than planned for the last 8 miles. However, we were greeted at The Swan with Two Nicks pub by Elizabeth's husband, Steve, and daughter, Emily, as well as Patrick. I congratulated Elizabeth on completing the longest ride she'd ever done on her 21-year old bike, Claude! Having 'done' photos, we headed to Elizabeth's house where eleven of us enjoyed a lovely meal, made by Elizabeth’s friend Jeanie.

Another day done. I went to bed and collapsed!&nbsp;
