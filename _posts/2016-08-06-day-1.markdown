Departure from Land End = 9.55am
<br>Miles cycled = 67.4
<br>Total ascent = 5371ft
<br>Wrong turns = 3 (all in Truro)
<br>Falls = 1 (at 0 mph)
<br>Arrival in Wadebridge = 5.35pm

After a hearty breakfast, we drove the 7 miles from the hotel to Land's End and the start of LEJOG. Before setting off, we had our photographs taken in front of the privately-run, '&pound;9.95-for-a-photo' sign. It was all a bit emotional for me, as I was asked what I wanted the sign to say. We did our posing, exchanged good wishes with a couple of cyclists and their support team who were doing LEJOG for Pancreatic Cancer in memory of a family member, Caroline, and then we set off for John O'Groats!

Whilst it's a cliche to say that it's not the destination that's important, but the journey, as far as LEJOG is concerned, I want to experience the journey fully. Consequently, completing each day as quickly as possible is not our priority.

The initial clear but cloudy day changed and the mist came in from the sea. This resulted in our first challenge- tiny droplets of water gathered on our spectacles which meant that it was extremely difficult to see the route on the Garmin. The mist turned to drizzle ('that rain that wets you' - according to Peter Kay) and, as we cycled along, we could imagine the stunning views in times of good visibility. Unfortunately, this morning was not one of those times.

The biggest decision of the day was whether to follow the diversion signs, which would take us off our route, or stick to the route despite the 'road closed' sign and risk unnecessary mileage if we had to retrace our steps. Feeling fresh, we decided to take the risk. A good decision - as we approached the village of Goldsithny, the road was closed for a village fete. We stopped and watched Morris Men performing their routine with sticks and bits of foliage. As it's harvest time, I'd hoped to see a bare-chested Poldark in the fields, as I like a bit of threshing. Sadly, this wasn't to be. However, my 'blog pal', Eddie the Drummer, who had accompanied the Morris Men came a close second.

When we'd completed a couple of hours of cycling, we met up with Jo, our driver and perfectionist Support Manager. What a delight to eat freshly made ham salad rolls and the largest Danish pastry I've ever seen! Restocked with fuel, we set off again. Shortly after this, the mist cleared and we did have some great views of the undulating terrain that lay ahead of us.

As we reached Truro, I was struggling with stomach cramps. Taking on a lot of food and then attempting to exercise is not a good idea. Unfortunately the only place available to lie down was the pavement. Someone stepped over me and someone else stopped their car to check I was ok - quite different responses. A few minutes of remaining supine eased the situation and we continued.

Most of our route took us on B and single track roads. It was noticeable that the roads were in a far better state than the ones in Oxfordshire. It must be all that EU funding that Cornwall has benefitted from! With 7 miles to go, we joined the Atlantic Highway (A39). We'd been used to the peace of the country lanes and 6 miles on this busy, fast highway was quite enough. We turned off the A39 and scooted down the hill into Wadebridge, feeling pleased that we'd got to our first destination. The Lidl car park seemed an ideal location to meet Jo. A hug to celebrate Day 1 success and then onto our accommodation.

We were greeted with a complimentary cream tea (even though it was almost 6pm), which was absolutely delicious! A quick shower and then onto Padstow for supper. We were driven to Rock and Jo waved the yellow flag to hail a water taxi - a new experience!

An enjoyable meal with Jo and Jonny and then back to our luxury B&B, where I collapsed in the Egyptian cotton sheets, feeling tired but positive.
