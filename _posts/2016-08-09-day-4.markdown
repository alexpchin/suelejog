We woke up to a beautiful morning in the small Somerset town of Axbridge. With a large support team for the day, there was much briefing and reviewing of maps over breakfast. Personally, I was procrastinating, as I was not looking forward to cycling up Cheddar Gorge after the trials of yesterday.&nbsp;

The tradition of the baton change took place in the parking area of a fruit farm with Karen handing the baton over to Day 4’s cyclist, Clem.

This is where we met blog-pal of the day – Graham, the soft fruit farmer. What a lovely man. Having taken a photo of today's crew, he told me that his father had “an issue with cancer," donated funds to our ever increasing sponsorship pot and then came back with a punnet of his fresh strawberries for us to enjoy.

Cheered on by our assembled supporters, the three of us pedaled off towards Cheddar Gorge, which is listed as one of the top 10 cycle routes in Britain. With a certain amount of trepidation, we began climbing the 1.75 'Ridgeways' and were pleasantly surprised. The crazy hills of the West Country had managed our expectations, and we soon got to the top, describing it as “easy, peasy” (the actual language used had the same meaning but was was rather more colourful and perhaps not appropriate for this blog!)

As the ascent was rather easier than anticipated, our 4-vehicle support crew convoy was not at the first designated meeting point by the time we arrived. We decided to cycle on and communicated that we'd push on to the stone circle at Stanton Drew. When we arrived there, there was still no sign of our support team. We managed to make contact with one of our crew, who was in the right village but at a different stone circle. Two other vehicles, driving together, had only received part of the voicemail message but arrived about 10 minutes later. The final vehicle was still missing. After three phone calls to provide directions, and a member of the team stationed at the entrance of the village to guide them in, they eventually joined the rest of us some 30 mins later. Much laughter followed and we eventually set off again, fed, watered and in good spirits.&nbsp;

The ‘road surface of the day’ goes to the Bristol and Bath railway path - a Sustrans cycle route with smooth Tarmac and no ascent or descent. It provided perfect cycling conditions and was very much appreciated.&nbsp;

As we approached our planned lunch stop, the Fleur de Lis pub in Pucklechurch, we were cheered in by the assembled support crew waving Cancer Research UK balloons. Tanisha, the CRUK Fundraising Manager from Day 0 had also made a guest appearance as she lives locally. It's so incredibly motivating to have the support of all these people who are joining along the route, as well as the kind words and encouragement from those of you who are supporting the challenge remotely.

After lunch, came the part of the journey that I was looking forward to most - cycling across the Severn Bridge. I love a suspension bridge and also the Severn Estuary. How thrilling it was to take my time cycling over the bridge, looking down at the mud flats, rather than rapidly driving across as I normally do. In fact, the time on the bridge was even longer than planned, due to the north westerly headwind, which was to significantly hinder our progress for the rest of the journey.&nbsp;

The next meeting point was Tintern Abbey - a beautiful location for our final break of the day and it was great to see friend Richard, who lives a couple of miles away in the welcome party. As I looked at the magnificent, monastic ruins, I was reminded of the words of Wordsworth’s poem ‘Lines of Tintern Abbey’:

“*While here I stand, not only with the sense*

*Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts*

*That in this moment there is life and food*

*For future years. And so I dare to hope...*"

I was feeling very upbeat as I left Tintern Abbey, as our sponsorship had just reached &pound;4,000. The sun, low in the sky, cast a beautiful, yellow light over the Wye Valley and I'd only got 16 miles left to run. With Clem needing to head home for meetings the following morning, Richard kindly offered to use his local knowledge to personally 'guide me in' to our hotel for the night.

I said goodbye to the members of the team who were going home and pedaled off. This last ascent was gruelling - almost 2 'Ridgeways' in a short distance. It was very challenging, as my legs were aching on the slightest hills after the exertion of Day 3. A very hard grind but eventually Ruby and I reached the summit. The next 5 miles were generally downhill but when I reached Coleford, I was feeling shattered. At this point, I decided that even though I was 8 miles short of my planned destination, I would abandon my cycling for the day and add this final section onto the Day 5 itinerary. A plan is meant to be flexible and adaptable to meet changing needs, and this was the right decision for me last night.&nbsp;

After a quick shower and change, I enjoyed a relaxed dinner and my rationed 125ml glass of Sauvignon Blanc with the support team. Day 5 would be my first day of cycling alone but I was looking forward to seeing what the next stage of the adventure would bring.
