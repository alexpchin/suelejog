The morning got off to an excellent start with a super breakfast spread from our host, Isobel, at the comfortable and tastefully decorated Bydand B&B. The range of fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, ham, cheese, toast and croissants was very appealing and I wanted to try everything. Tempting as it was, I managed to make some culinary choices. Instead of my usual bacon (well done please), scrambled eggs and grilled tomatoes, I supplemented the continental elements with a plate of fluffy pancakes, local berries, warm compote and cr&egrave;me fraiche. Washed down with my usual morning Berocca (me, “but on a good day”, according to the marketing); it was all delicious. I felt good.

After breakfast, Isobel very kindly handed us a cheque towards our fundraising target. We wished that we’d been able to linger a little longer in her beautiful house but we said our goodbyes and made the short drive into Grantown-on-Spey, where we'd finished the previous evening. Jo art directed the morning’s obligatory photo shoot with our growing band of supporters, and 'Scottish Jo' and I pedalled off once more into the distance.

After leaving the stone-built town, we cycled across the bleak terrain of the Dava moor and I appreciated yet again how different my experience over the past 12 days would have been without such generally kind weather.

The moorland eventually turned into woodland - silver birch with an undergrowth of bracken and gorse and, where it was more open, the ubiquitous purple heather. Before long, the silver birch trees were gradually replaced with coniferous trees. As we wound our way down single track roads, we once again felt as though we were the only people for miles.

We reached our first meeting point, after 23 miles, relatively quickly. Here we enjoyed the camaraderie of our supporters - Jackie, Linda, Jock and Patrick - and some moist, lemon drizzle cake, which Jackie had baked and transported all the way from her home in Lower Heyford in Oxfordshire. Jo was missing from the team, as she'd gone to pick up her husband, ‘Chinny,’ from Inverness airport. The fact that he was flying up to meet us from Heathrow really emphasised the distance that I'd travelled so far (and he was only coming from London, not Cornwall!). We confirmed the lunch stop and then sped on towards the city of Inverness and the excitement of the Kessock Bridge across the Moray Firth. On our way, we passed the Culloden viaduct, an impressive piece of Victorian engineering.

As we were bypassing Inverness to the east via the A96 and the A9, rather than cycling through the city, our 'wrong turn' tally, which normally increases exponentially in a city, stayed low. The challenge was crossing three lanes of fast moving traffic on this busy highway in order to turn right. We did take a wrong turn at one point but probably saved a mile by only cycling three sides of an equilateral triangle.  Suspension bridge number 3 on my journey, was, quite literally, another high moment.

Jo and I took an obligatory selfie (a slight improvement on the one taken on the Severn Bridge) halfway across, and then pedalled on.

As we were coming to the end of the bridge, I screeched to a halt and shouted to Jo to stop, as I’d spotted two men with hard hats and high vis jackets. Hugh and Iain kindly agreed to have their photos taken as blog-pals.

Once over the Moray Firth, we cycled onwards to our lunch stop at Munlochy. When we got there, I was pleased to hug my old friend, Chinny, who’d arrived from the airport, and filled him in on the craziness of LEJOG. Before leaving for the airport, Jo had provided clear instructions to Jackie, Jock and Linda regarding the purchasing of provisions (never have I been so indulged, as I have in the last 2 weeks, both in terms of my food and emotional requirements) and so we enjoyed our usually tasty picnic. Today’s spread included what Jo refers to as 'toddler food' - sliced apple with spoonsful of peanut butter served in a plastic, picnic bowl. The crispness and tartness of the apple offsets the cloying, salty-sweet peanut butter – it’s scrumptious! Intrigued by this new culinary combination, other members of the team dipped in and all gave it the thumbs up and Jock was thrilled that he was allowed to scrape out the peanut butter jar.

Having stayed in the sunshine, once again, for rather longer, Jo and I got back on our bikes and headed onwards. The road from lunch took us upward. It was one of those roads that looks flat but feels like quite hard work and, as I looked at the elevation on the Garmin, I saw we'd climbed more than a Ridgeway. We were rewarded with both a downhill sweep and a fantastic view of the Cromarty Forth.

By this point, I was getting excited about crossing another significant bridge, and, as we approached the bridge, I saw the first road sign to John O'Groats - 109 miles via the A9. Our route would be quite a bit longer but the fact that it was there, on a road sign, suddenly made it seem achievable. The ride over the bridge didn't disappoint. I felt on a high as I pedalled across, feeling very lucky to be fit enough to embark on this challenge; to see so many beautiful parts of the UK (Leigh and environs on Day 6 an exception); to know so many fantastic, supportive people; and generally exceptionally glad to be alive. When we reached the other side of the Firth, our route took us onto the A9, a very busy, single carriageway road with fast-moving traffic. Despite great views of the water, we decided to try and find a safer route, where we feared less for our lives. We left the A9 and went up an unclassified road. We'd tried to work out an alternative route from the ripped out page 102 of the road atlas but were slightly confused and, as we stopped at a level crossing, a car approached. In it was a Belgian family, who were on holiday in the UK - dad Benois, mum Laurie and their two young children. They weren't 100% sure but believed that we were going in the right direction for Alness. We thanked them for the directions and they wished us good luck, driving off with the kids grinning and waving wildly through the rear windscreen. On the other side of the level crossing, a mum returning home having done the school run confirmed that we were indeed on the right track.

Despite the sunshine, beautiful views and excellent companionship of cyclist Jo, the day was getting tougher. It wasn't really difficult cycling but I'd got to the stage in the day when my rear was feeling battered again and my thighs were rebelling. I was watching the Garmin and the miles to our destination were reducing at what seemed like the slowest rate of the whole journey so far. I voiced some frustration to Jo, who was fantastically supportive and encouraging but I was feeling at an all time low. Not many miles back I'd been on a high, so I'm not sure how I sunk to this level of despair in such a short period of time but when we arrived at our afternoon meeting point with the six-strong team of supporters cheering wildly, I threw my arms around one of them and sobbed. They probably didn’t know how to deal with me and I felt that I was letting them down. It took some time for me to pull myself together but with their support and a freshly made cup of peppermint tea, I felt ready to get back on Ruby.

The next part of the journey involved more climbing. I could cope with this, as the hills were more significant and you tend to feel as though you’ve achieved something when you reach the top of a high-altitude climb. Soon, we saw a sign that said, 'Viewing point 1 mile' and were optimistic that a downhill ride would follow. As we approached the viewing area, we saw that our supporters were there (and were probably relieved to find me in a better frame of mind) and we were all rewarded by an amazing panorama of Dornach Firth. What a view!

Spirits lifted, we then headed onto our finish point at Bonar Bridge - another day with a downhill sweep to take us to our destination and long-awaited reunion with our supporters. Today has been a day of absolute highs and absolute lows but we only have one and a half days to go. Who knows what these two days will bring, physically or emotionally!
