I made sure that I woke up when Bruce started singing this morning by setting 3 alarms. Looking out of the window, I could see that it had been raining in the night, as the slate roofs were shiny. The BBC weather app forecasted a combination of dark cloud, rain and sun for the next few hours and then it would be dry.&nbsp;

Jo and I were by ourselves today. We got on with our usual routine of highlighting the route on our road atlases over breakfast, agreed the stops, and packed the car. Then we set off from our hotel for last night’s finishing point to start Day 8.

I should have pumped up the tyres before we left Kirby Lonsdale but was keen to get moving and so left that task for when we took Ruby off the car at High Bentham. However, as I attached the pump and starting to inflate them, I could see that there was more air escaping than was going in. Much as I tried to beat the escaping air by pumping furiously, I was getting nowhere and the tyres were getting softer and softer. Luckily, we had noticed numerous signs for a bike shop on our way to the start, so decided to drive back. Once we got there, I took Ruby off the roof of the car and Jo ran inside, shouting, "We've got a bit of a crisis" to the only assistant in the shop ([Escape Bikes](http://www.escapebikeshop.com/)), who was busy serving someone else. A very helpful chap, he had a go at inflating the tyres and had the same problem. He then dismantled the pump and tried again. (Technically speaking) there was a problem with some kind of washer-thingy not being screwed in properly but this was now sorted. The bike shop assistant has to be blog-pal of the day, as he managed to get us back on the road in no time at all. When I asked his name, he said that it was, "Aran but with the Welsh spelling.” I assumed that meant that it had 'LLs' spread liberally throughout it but apparently it's spelt 'Arawn'. The other customers in the shop were keen to know what these two, slightly histrionic women were up to. We explained and they asked if we had a support team with us. They looked rather bemused when we told them there were just the two of us and, given our inability to pump up the tyres this morning, I think they wondered how on earth we'd got this far!

After another delayed start, I set off from the bike shop alone, as there was no-one to take baton today.

Before long, I was back in Kirkby Lonsdale, where we’d spent the previous night. When I passed the golf club, I realised that it was Saturday and thought of my friends who would be playing right now at Frilford Heath, my golf club.&nbsp;

There were no horrible urban bits on the ride today. As I headed for the first break, the top of the hills was still shrouded with cloud and it all looked rather atmospheric.&nbsp;

Approaching the first stop, I picked up a text from Jo who advised that she was already at the crossroads. A couple of minutes later I stopped to pick up another text.

When I arrived, Jo had got the kettle on to make me my favourite peppermint tea. After realizing that she was at the wrong crossroads, she'd rapidly packed the still-full kettle into the car to avoid the delay of having to boil the water again.&nbsp;

I rode through some beautiful scenery towards the lunch stop - very green, low lying pasture, with fells behind. A climb up to 989ft and then my favourite, a long downhill sweep, before starting the climb up to the highest point of the day. I stopped part way up the climb in a village called Orton, where there was a farmers' market. Here I was approached by a man called David, who after checking whether I was a vegetarian, offered me a taste of his spicy, chicken sausage. He was packing up and needed to get rid of his samples. The sausage was not overpoweringly spicy but with a hint of chilli after about 10 seconds. Like many of the people I've met en route, David and his brother, Stuart, were delightful.&nbsp;

I pedalled on and eventually got to 1,134ft. The view from here was stunning - the tough pastureland, broken up by dry stone walls and big hills way into the distance. I really felt as though I was on top of the world. This was certainly one of the highlights of Day 8.&nbsp;

After this, it was downhill to lunch, passing by stone cottages and farms. One of the villages, Crosby Ravensworth, which was particularly picturesque, had a charity outdoor concert and as I cycled through 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours' was playing. Another highlight in such a short space of time.&nbsp;

At the next village, Jo had the picnic set up on the grass beside the river. Life is good!&nbsp;

I set for after lunch along a relatively flat track, which followed the river for a period of time before reaching the village of Langwathby. The station here is famous for the station cafe scene in the movie ‘Brief Encounter'. I never did understand why Celia Johnson went back to her very boring husband when she had a far better relationship with a man that she really connected with in Trevor Howard. I guess it was all about being decent and doing the right thing, even if it makes your life dull!&nbsp;

From this point on, the journey got more difficult, not because there were huge hills to ascend but just because I’d reached the afternoon low point, when I wanted it to be over. I'd forgotten to use the Chamois cream on my rear that morning and I was getting uncomfortable in the saddle. It seemed a long way to Jo in Lazonby, which was not a pretty village but the man in the pub was decent and allowed us to use their facilities.&nbsp;

I knew that there was some climbing up to and beyond the next village, so I gritted my teeth and got on with it. It was hard work. I encountered Jo waiting at the bottom of another hill to give me some encouragement. I didn't notice the 20% sign but she flagged it up, as we discussed the day later that evening. The next 10 miles continued in an undulating fashion and I tried to make the most of the downhill momentum whenever I could to get me back up again. With two miles to go, I really had had enough. Then at the side of the road, I saw a couple with a Cancer Research UK banner. I was confused, as I could see that it wasn't my university friend Pam and her husband Ken, who were due to join for dinner. As I got closer, I realised that it was Lesley, whom I worked with at Bayer and her husband Dave. Their presence was a great motivator for me to push on for the last couple of miles (particularly as it was mainly downhill). I pedalled like fury into Brampton, where I was also greeted by Pam and Ken.&nbsp;

The six of us had a drink in the bar and discussed the madness of LEJOG and then, after a very quick shower and change, Pam and Ken joined Jo and me for dinner. We reminisced about old times and Pam let it slip that I had been a bridesmaid at their wedding 25 years ago. (Editor’s note: I wasn’t going to let this one slip away without a photo!)

Again, it was lovely to meet up with friends and to share the craziness of this world with them!&nbsp;
