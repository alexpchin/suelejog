After the pleasure of the Egyptian cotton sheets on our super-comfy beds at Trewornan Manor, we experienced the delights of the best B&B breakfast any of us had ever had. Bowls of fresh fruit, poached plums, fruit compote and homemade granola; fluffy blueberry pancakes with maple syrup; avocado on toast; scrambled eggs and bacon and nutty granary toast with marmalade. The food was delicious and plentiful.

The stunning listed Manor House, dating from 1211, was tastefully decorated, and Paul and Lesley were the perfect hosts. It was a shame to have to leave, as a morning here with the Sunday papers would have been a real treat. However, Great Torrington called.

For the first 10 miles of the day, we threaded our way through a knot of unclassified roads, passing through delightful villages with houses built of the local grey-brown stone or whitewashed. As we pedaled on, our route got closer to the coast and we caught occasional glimpses of the fields falling down into the sea. Jonny and I felt that today's route was prettier than Day 1 but appreciated that we might be influenced by the bright blue skies. Close to the coast, the undulations developed into steeper ups and downs. 'Steep' at one stage was 30%. With this gradient and a single track road, we didn't manage to pedal all the way to the top of the 400ft hill but we were pleased to make it halfway up before getting off to push.

Our first meeting with Jo was planned for Boscastle and we'd given an estimated arrival time. However, due to the challenges of the hills, we were way behind schedule. There was no phone signal in Boscastle on O2 or Vodaphone, so despite the two-phone plan, we had no way of keeping in touch. Our delay and the lack of any possible communication meant that Jo was starting to think about driving back along the route to check if we were okay. Our arrival, 40 minutes after the ETA, was greeted with relief.

My unit of height when cycling is measured in 'Ridgeways'. From my house to the top of the Ridgeway is 400ft. The climb out of Boscastle was a challenge, as it was initially steep and 2 Ridgeways high. When we met Jo later, she mentioned the huge mass of hydrangeas in a myriad of blues and pinks tumbling over a wall at the side of the road. I had seen no plants of any kind, just the road ahead of me!

Moving on after our morning coffee, we had some stunning views of the north Cornwall coast. Probably the best of all was the view of Widemouth Bay. It 'does what it says on the tin' - a huge bay with spectacular folded rocks. Very dramatic.

We met up again for lunch in Bude, where Jo provided us with our "themed Devon picnic". Ahead of the game, as always, as we were still in Cornwall. We had fresh, Boscastle crab sandwiches and locally baked walnut bread with cheese and Devon chutney, eaten on the grass by the side of the river.

We had a choice of featured blog pals today – Paul, the perfect host at Trewornan Manor, and our Italian chums, Serena and Joe, who were cycling around the West Country for a week, were contenders. However, the winners were Ron and Vera, a delightful couple who had moved to Bodmin from Normanton in West Yorkshire 30 years ago. They were fascinated to hear about our adventure and if Jo hadn’t insisted on us getting back on the road sharpish, Ron would probably still be talking to Jonny now!

As we crossed into Devon, the terrain seemed much kinder. We felt that we'd done the hard graft on the hills in Cornwall and were reaping the rewards. However, our final town of the day provided a sting in the tail. To get some idea of the ascent into Great Torrington, cast your mind back to the hill in the location Hovis ad, without the cobbles but several times the length. It was absolutely punishing. A couple of locals gave us some motivating words, as we climbed steadily and huffed and puffed our way to the top. We felt real sense of achievement when we made it!

So, the end of Day 2 and what a day! Once more, I was pleased to collapse into my bed, setting my alarm for 6.15am tomorrow to prepare for the dreaded Day 3 – nearly 80 miles and over 6,000ft. Watch this space…..
