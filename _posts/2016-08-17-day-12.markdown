At breakfast, I had heavy legs and a heavy heart. Today was going to be a challenging day, as we’d be cycling north through the Cairngorms National Park, which is twice the size of the Lake District. Our route would take us via the Lecht Ski Centre, 2,090ft above ski level. Despite encouraging words from Jo, Patrick and Jo W, I was feeling down. The marmalade didn't help. I enjoy a thick-cut, orange marmalade and put a large spoonful of said marmalade on my toast. However, as I bit into the toast, it tasted foul. I looked at the label on the jar, which clearly spelled out ‘MARMALADE' in large letters. A closer look revealed, in a much smaller font, the words 'with honey.’ What would possess anyone to add the Devil's food to marmalade? Honey is the only food that I really don't like; to me it smells of dirty people and tastes equally disgusting.

Breakfast drama over, we loaded the cars and drove back to the Spittal. Unfortunately, though, we missing a turning and what should have been a 12-mile drive, ended up being almost double the distance. This unplanned detour only served to further my procrastination of the inevitable.

Still, with some considerable apprehension, I managed to raise a smile for the obligatory “off they go” photo shoot at the Spittal.

Images captured, Jo and I pedalled off into the National Park. The road was initially undulating but we could see it rising in the distance.

This first hill would take us to our highest point of the day at 2,258ft (&gt; 3 Ridgeways). Whilst we were ascending, I kept a close eye on the Garmin’s altitude reading; each 100ft of ascent was getting us closer to the top. Just over halfway up, I shouted to Jo to stop. A swig of water and an apple crumble flavoured gel gave me a slight psychological boost. With the altitude reading 2,000ft, we were almost there. Keep breathing, keep pedalling. Yay! The first significant hill of the day had been conquered. Patrick was there to greet us at the summit, so the three of us had a Team Ambo hug and then a photo to mark the moment.

However, in our jubilation at reaching the summit, Jo fell off his bike into a muddy puddle, sustaining cuts to his arm. Fortunately, Patrick had a towel to hand, so dried him down and managed to get rid of most of the mud!

We were then rewarded with a fantastic, long downhill ride. On this now cloudless morning, the hills looked absolutely awesome. We tracked a river for some time and admired the beautiful old stone bridges.

We made it to our first agreed stop of the day, Braemar, relatively quickly and here we enjoyed hot drinks and homemade cakes in a lovely coffee shop. Sitting on the terrace in the sunshine admiring the views was very enjoyable and we had a far longer stop than was planned (although this was not that unusual.)

The next part of our journey tracked the River Dee for a few miles and was relatively easy cycling. We'd decided to take a slight detour to Balmoral Castle, where we met our first blog-pal of the day - Constable Gordon Jelleyman. Gordon is in the Met and usually based in Windsor. However, he has been stationed at Balmoral for three months, as they don’t have enough local security. Gordon wished us well and we headed off.

The weather really could not have been any better for us to appreciate the beauty of the mountains. As we climbed another hill, Jo had a problem with his chain. We got off, put the chain back on and continue pedalling. However, as soon as Jo put any significant pressure on the pedals on the uphill bits, the chain stopped working. He freewheeled downhill and then at the bottom of the next hill, decided that a 'man with a tool' was needed. Unless it was attended to, his bike was never going to get him over the Lecht. Amazingly, in this wilderness,

we managed to pick up a phone signal, so I phoned for a support vehicle to come and pick up Jo and his bike, to transport them to a bike shop. Support arrived in 15 mins and they zoomed off to Ballater in the hope that there was a bike shop. Fortune was with them and the 'man with a tool' turned about to be blog-pal number 2, Kirsten at [Bike Station](http://www.bikestationballater.co.uk/).

In the meantime, I continued to cycle on solo. In this open, moorland area, there was no protection from the sun and it was incredibly hot as I slowly pedalled up the long hill.

It seemed an incredibly long way to Jo at our lunch stop in Corgarff but once I found her, I tucked into the delicious sandwiches she’d made with malty Balmoral bread, cheese, ham and Yorkshire pickle (which has replaced the Devon chutney we have so enjoyed until now). After about ten minutes, cyclist Jo and his fully-functioning bike were delivered safely back. Soon it was time to go and, once again, I didn't want to leave the picnic stop. We were part-way up a very steep hill and I didn't feel motivated to get back on my bike. Taking silly photos on an ornamental stag, delayed our start for a bit

and then the arrival of friends, Jock and Linda, was a good reason to put off the inevitable for a bit longer.

Eventually, we moved off. This was now the ascent to the Lecht Ski Centre - even steeper than the climb up the Spittal and very hot in the sunshine. It was the sort of hill where it looked as though you were nearing the summit and then the road rose even higher around the next bend. Finally, it opened up and we could see clearly where we were going.

Jo continued pedalling on and I certainly wasn’t going to let it beat me, so I puffed and grunted my way slowly upwards.

Eventually, we reached the ski station at 2,209ft. It was very hard work but very satisfying and the aching thighs had managed to get me up.

Once again, we were rewarded with a fantastic downhill ride to our final planned stop at Tomintoul. Joining Jock, Linda and Patrick in a tea shop, I really didn't need a piece of date slice but it seemed rude to refuse. I was feeling elated at this point having conquered the Lecht.

We now only had 15 miles to go to our destination in Grantown-on-Spey. Jo had warned about the climb from Bridge of Brown but I wasn't quite expecting the cheeky hill that lay ahead of me. As we cycled down the gorge, we could see the hill rising up the other side. This was not what we needed at the end of the day. Another huffing, puffing, grunting hill, which I was determined I'd get up without getting off. A lot of grinding was required and it seemed to take forever but I was getting there. Just before the summit, we had an unscheduled stop as Jo (Support Manager and all round good egg) was parked in a layby with new supporter, my friend Jackie, and mugs of peppermint tea. We described the madness that is this LEJOG trip to Jackie and enjoyed the views in the early evening sunlight.

It's always great to end the day with a downhill run and we had 5 miles of it into Grantown-on-Spey where we met the now assembled support team – Jo, Patrick, Jock, Linda and Jackie.

Blog-pal number 3, Matthew, took our photo. He explained that he was with his mum who had completed her chemotherapy for lung cancer - yet another reason to push on with this crazy LEJOG and raise more sponsorship.

This was a challenging day but the scenery was spectacularly beautiful and I was feeling on a high, despite my thighs feeling even heavier. The support team have been great but their challenge now is to get me through the next two and a half days!
