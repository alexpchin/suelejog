I woke up at 7.15am and panicked. How had I managed to sleep through Bruce at 6.30am? I'd been too tired to write the blog the night before and so had that to complete before breakfast. I also needed to sort out the first part of the route, as I’d finished the previous day at a more scenic location than originally planned. My general state was rather less positive than on previous days, as I'd found yesterday’s simple undulations hard work and couldn't imagine how I'd got up those hills in the West Country. Finally, I'd suffered from what Davina McCall described as ' undercarriage issues' and couldn’t imagine getting back on Ruby after finishing last night. All was not good in the LEJOG world.&nbsp;

I looked at the weather for the day. In this crazy LEJOG world, I've lost all track of days and the BBC weather app is therefore a useful hint as to which day of the week it is. If today is the day before Saturday, it must be Friday! What have things come to? With that done I sprang into action, feeling tense.&nbsp;

With Ruby loaded, we set off to meet marathon runner Clive, a local Cancer Research UK Ambassador, and his wife Linda. School chum, Elizabeth, handed the baton over to Clive and off we set.&nbsp;

After a short time, we left behind the leafy lanes of Cheshire and cycled through some less scenic parts of the North West. Signs for places like Leigh and Wigan made me realise that the only thing I know about these towns is that they have rugby league teams. I wasn't inspired to find out anything else, as the first 20 miles was the least aesthetically pleasing cycle of the trip so far.&nbsp;

We had arranged to meet Jo and Linda at The Bay Horse Inn at Heath Charnock. The pub stood on an unclassified road, so Jo and I had numerous communications to check that Clive and I were going to the right place. Frustratingly, one of my navigation errors took us down a hill, which meant that we had to retrace our steps upwards. The good news was that we had a good signal on all our communication devices and the availability of 4G meant that Jo could see me on the ‘Life360’ tracker app on her phone. As we pedalled toward the rest stop, we saw Jo and Linda and two other people whom I assumed were a couple that Jo had pulled out of the pub to hold the Cancer Research UK banner. As I came to a halt and the man spoke, I was shocked to see that it was my Bruvver, Chris, and his partner Ellie. What a lovely surprise. With Jo's ability to organise these 'people surprises' I'll be disappointed if she hasn't got Bruce playing Thunder Road in John O'Groats!

Clive's original plan had been to stop at this point and for Linda to take him home. However, they decided to stay with us for the rest of the day: an unexpected and very welcome 3-vehicle support team.

As I cycled on, the route became rather more appealing, as it became more rural. I crossed the Leeds Liverpool canal just north of Chorley and started climbing. En-route to my 2nd official stop at Mellor, I met blog-pal of the day, John, who was overtaking me on a hill. We had a brief conversation, he gave some words of encouragement and we stopped for a selfie. If you're reading this John, thanks for checking out my blog and thank you for your sponsorship!

My favourite place name so far was a village which 'did what it said on the tin'. A name only possible in Lancashire.&nbsp;

At Mellor, I was pleased to see that the elevation was 650ft, as I knew I needed to climb to nearly 1,400ft. That was &gt; 3 'Ridgeways' from the lowest point but &lt; 2 from here. We sat outside the pub on wooden chairs that were fixed to the ground. I've never seen this before. It didn't look like the sort of area that the chairs would be nicked, but presumably they'd either had problems before or were being ultra-cautious.&nbsp;

I left with the thought of almost another 2 'Ridgeways' to climb but feeling much better than I'd felt at the beginning of the day. A navigation error took me on a dual carriageway and on a detour into the town of Clitheroe, which was at an altitude of only 250ft. Back to 3 'Ridgeways' to climb!&nbsp;

From here the landscape became very rural and much bleaker. I cycled into the Forest of Bowland, which is a completely inappropriate name for this area of outstanding natural beauty, as there wasn’t a tree in sight. I'd imagined cycling in a leafy glade but instead found myself cycling over open moorland, where the strengthening wind did nothing to aid my ascent.

It was a long, hard grind up to 1,250ft and an easy descent down to 450ft. This meant another long climb up to the high point of 1,393ft, where Bruvver and Ellie cheered me on.

In this bleak landscape and the evening sunlight, the yellow grass and purple heather looked stunning. Despite the hard work climbing, this ranked with Exmoor as one of the most beautiful parts of my journey so far. At one point I saw the three support vehicles disappearing into the distance and felt that I was the only person here for miles.

It was quite a liberating feeling and made me feel strangely confident. Just me pitted against the harsh terrain and I was gradually beating it (including the bits of road which have arrows marking the steep sections in the road atlas.)&nbsp;

After a lot of hard grind, I reached our final meeting place, Slaidburn: a surprisingly attractive village, where I found my loyal supporters sitting outside a pretty pub.

This is the only day where all three main meeting points have been at pubs. Clive and Bruvver is this your influence? At this point there were only 12 miles to run and I enjoyed leapfrogging with the support vehicles before finally making it to High Bentham. Yay!!! I was feeling physically really good. It had been a hard day, with contrasting scenery, but my mood was at the opposite end of the spectrum to the morning.

The usual hugs ensued. We said our goodbyes to Bruvver, Ellie, Clive and Linda and headed off to our accommodation in the small market town of Kirkby Lonsdale.&nbsp;

I had a very rapid shower in time for supper with my 'snowshoeing chums', Andy, Sue, Paula (aka Binkie) and surprise guest Dave, Paula's husband. I'd been told he couldn't join us as he was sea kayaking - his retaliation for my surprise visit for his 50th birthday hike in the Lake District earlier this year. We all had a good catch-up and chatted excitedly about our walking holiday in the Picos mountains in 2 weeks’ time.&nbsp;

Another good day and we’re now almost half way!&nbsp;
