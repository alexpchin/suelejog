Breakfast at the Lairg Highland Hotel was in complete contrast to our experience ‘chez Isobel’ on the previous morning. The waitress was abrupt; there was no fruit of any kind on the unappealing buffet; and the request for peppermint tea was met with a grunt. This was not going to set us up for the day, so Linda went to the car and fetched some fresh fruit from our picnic store to supplement the disappointing fayre. The accommodation on our “antepenultimate” night had disappointed us in many ways but the banter and camaraderie at breakfast was uplifting.&nbsp;

I was feeling in good spirits, as we drove back to Bonar Bridge and my mood was enhanced further by listening to the deep, velvet tones of Leonard Cohen. He’s not everyone's cup of tea, I know, but it works for me!

The usual, ‘starting line’ photoshoot took place at Bonar Bridge, with Creative Director, Jo, moving “the talent” this way and that, to avoid the “contrasty” light. The baton was passed to new cyclist, Priya, who had come up to Scotland to join Jo W and me on the penultimate day. Photos ‘in the can,’ our seven-strong team of supporters bid us farewell and we set off for the small village of Melvich on Scotland’s North Coast, our final overnight stop.

On our way back towards Lairg, we noticed a camper van parked on the other side of the road. We shouted greetings and realised that it was a group doing JOGLE (a reverse LEJOG), so I shouted to Jo and Priya to stop. We scooted back for a quick chat, interrupting their breakfast. In the camper we met a family - granddaughter (Hannah, age 13), son Trevor, and Peggy (age 73). Peggy and Hannah were cycling to Land’s End and Trevor was providing support. They were raising money for the North Devon Wheelers - to develop a grass cycle track and provide some bikes to encourage kids' cycling around their native Bideford. We’d stayed near Bideford on Day 2 and now, it seemed an age away. (‘Logistics Jo’ and I feel as though we've been locked in this LEJOG bubble for months and can barely remember the routine of our ‘normal’ life.) We discovered that Peggy Crome is a world class triathlete and, when we did our own research later, found that she’d written articles and appears on YouTube. She was a really interesting lady and it was lovely that she was doing JOGLE with her granddaughter.

Reaching Lairg,10 miles up the road, was a milestone, as we’d now pedalled back to where we’d stayed the night before. We took the opportunity to use the facilities at the Highland Hotel and then cycled onto new terrain. The landscape was open, wild and beautiful.

The terrain was climbing continuously but the ascent was gentle. The road we were on was an A road but it was a single track with passing places. I've never seen an A road like this before! A few miles down the road, we noticed a police car and a couple of officers having a discussion with a man. I interrupted and asked if they would be blog-pals. Iain and Paul obliged and suggested that the vehicle was also in the shot. As I cycled off, I wished I'd responded differently to their comment, "That's fine as long as you don't want the handcuffs."

We cycled on to our first planned stop at the Crask Inn, the only inhabited building for miles, where we were welcomed by the support team holding the Cancer Research banner and waving wildly. The team ensured our coffee needs were met with service from the dourest of Scotsmen, and we tucked into cake from the support vehicle, including an iced ginger cake from a local bakery and the rich, fruit cake that Jo had purchased at the Tebay Services Farm Shop. A visit to the ladies’ loo identified an item which I immediately identified as “tat of the tour” – a mouse fashioned out of shells. Why?

Supporter and good friend, Jock, had mentioned, in conversation the previous day, that his father had told him to look for a penny on the floor each day. He decided to scour the car park of the Crask and, within a minute, he came back into the pub, delighted with a shiny, 2p find. Where others may have stopped, this motivated him to continue. He soon returned to the group, having found more treasure - a 5p piece. This made him feel there could be even more bounty and then discovered a 1p. How productive his morning had been. Little did he realise that when he'd mentioned he was going to look for money, Jackie had thrown these three coins down in the car park. Sorry Jock, you provided such amusement and entertainment to the rest of us! Thank you for donating the 8p treasure and the balancing &pound;19.92 to our sponsorship fund.&nbsp;

We left the Crask Inn and cycled on. The earlier clouds had lifted and the day was turning out to be our fourth consecutive sunny day in Scotland (probably the first time this had happened since records began!) The wind was increasing, as we cycled down the very gradual incline along the side of a river. However, it wasn’t a headwind, so it didn’t pose a problem as we travelled northwards.

Cycling in the opposite direction we met Janet and Kevin from Western Australia, who were doing JOGLE in 20 days. I didn't envy them carrying all their luggage in panniers.

At the village of Altnaharra, we turned off the main road onto a smaller track along the side of Loch Naver. This was where the wind became a problem, as we were primarily travelling eastwards. Jo and Priya kindly took it in turns to shield me from the wind and I rode at the back of our peloton. It was difficult enough for me, so goodness knows how the wind felt to them. After about 7 miles, we left the loch and headed northwards to our lunch destination. There was significant relief, as the cycling became easier due to the significantly reduced wind resistance. I thanked my fellow cyclists for their help, as they posed for a photo.

Our lunch stop was at a beautiful location at the side of the river Naver.&nbsp;

Jackie and Patrick had been well trained for their first lunch service by Jo, who had gone off to sort a few things out with Chinny, Jock and Linda. Once again, our food requirements were indulged with sandwiches freshly prepared on our arrival with ham from the butcher in Bonar Bridge, Tain Truckle cheddar, Brie, and optional Yorkshire pickle. Three varieties of cake were offered and this was washed down with freshly brewed, peppermint tea. I did ask if we needed to fill in a feedback form to report back to Jo on their performance but they advised that they hadn’t yet been given any objectives to be appraised against!

&nbsp;

The post-lunch cycle ride was mostly flat with undulations. We pushed on at a crazy speed towards Bettyhill (a location not a woman), making the most of the downhill rides to get us the uphill stretches. As we joined the A836, (which now had 2 lanes), there was a sign showing that the distance to my final destination was only 55 miles. Yay! (photo 11)&nbsp;

The scenery, as we approached our afternoon stop was breathtaking. There can't be many better views and, after feasting my eyes on this view, I didn't even mind the ascent to reach the support team. (photo 12).&nbsp;

It was at this final stop that we met Clive, who was also doing JOGLE. He'd only decided to do the ride the previous week and appeared considerably less organised than anyone else we'd met. He was going to give it a go but thought he'd be lucky to reach his sister's in Preston: a lovely man and great entertainment value. (photo 13).&nbsp;

As we moved on, we realised that the final 15 miles to our accommodation would be the most difficult section of the day. We were travelling eastwards and cycling straight into 33mph winds. The road twisted and turned, as it generally followed the shape of the coast along this most northerly part of the British mainland. The elevation also followed the natural contours of the land, which, at this point, was rather more than undulating. It was really tough struggling against the wind as we ascended. I stayed in my lowest gear and pedalled slowly, grinding my way upwards. For some reason, I was now feeling stronger and my thighs coped well with the demands of the terrain and the wind. The road surface wasn’t great and created extra friction, so I tried to cycle on the painted white line marking the edge of the road to reduce one at least one of the forces acting against me. At some points, and it generally seemed to be the downhill bits, the wind was a crosswind. This was frightening as I’d never cycled in such strong winds before and Ruby's light frame trembled, as we were blown sideways. Still, we pushed on and the road signs gradually counted down the distance to Melvich. We arrived at The Melvich Hotel feeling triumphant that we'd beaten the terrain and wind.&nbsp;

Our band of seven vociferous supporters with banners and balloons were supplemented at the side of the road by a holidaying Australian couple, Marie and Lindsay, who kindly made a donation towards our sponsorship target. The usual hugs and photos ensued and I then collapsed in the bath with lots of bubbles.&nbsp;

With Day 14 now completed, I only have half a day to go to my final destination, John O’Groats. However, the strong winds are forecasted to continue, so we're expecting headwinds all the way. It’s not looking as though these last 40 miles are going be a doddle….&nbsp;
