I am cycling from Land’s End to John O’Groats to raise money and awareness for Cancer Research UK because I’m passionate about Beating Cancer Sooner.

My husband, Philip, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2005. By the end of 2008, the standard treatments, which had provided periods of disease-free progression and good Quality of Life, had been exhausted – there were no more licensed drugs in the cupboard. By this stage Philip’s QOL was such that he was not well enough to stay overnight at a friend’s house down the road. In January 2009, he started in a study of a trial drug, abiraterone. The impact of this drug was amazing; after 3 weeks Philip was researching flights to Cape Town. We had a very special holiday with friends in South Africa and subsequently played golf in Portugal, visited friends in Provence, and taught our neighbours how to sail a yacht in Greece. The impact of this drug on his QOL, and consequently my QOL, was staggering. Sadly, Philip died on Christmas Day 2009 but had enjoyed an extended period of time with improved QOL to spend with family and friends.

Abiraterone was initially developed by Cancer Research UK. It was licensed and became available to men in the UK in 2012. With continued investment in research, more people can survive cancer and for patients where this is not the case, more effective treatments can provide them with an improved QOL that they and their families and friends can benefit from.

Since Philip died, I have completed a number of challenges to raise money and awareness for Cancer Research UK including the Three Peaks Challenge, Coast-to-Coast (C2C) and London to Paris cycle rides, walking 26 miles through the night in Manchester, and climbing Kilimanjaro. This is my 2016 adventure!

It isn’t an organised event. I’ll be cycling the whole 1011 miles from Land’s End to John O’Groats and friends will be joining me on some of the legs. Jon, Clem, Elizabeth, Holly, Clive, Priya and Jo W will all be doing some pedalling and offering support and companionship on the road. Friend Jo Chin will be driving the support vehicle for the whole period and providing emotional support and cups of tea and cake. I’m looking forward to other friends popping by for dinner and a glass of wine, as we make our way up through the country. Meet them all, as they join the party, on our [Friends](/friends/) page.

My LEJOG is more than just a physical challenge. I’m supporting Cancer Research UK to Beat Cancer Sooner but also ‘getting on my bike’ to make the most of this wonderful life I have with family and friends. I hope you’ll enjoy sharing this journey with me by following our daily [Blog](/blog/) or popping down to see us along the route.

“What are you waiting for?!”
