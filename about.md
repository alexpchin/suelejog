I am cycling from Lands End to John O'Groats to raise money and awareness for Cancer Research UK because I'm passionate about Beating Cancer Sooner.

This is my 2016 adventure! It isn't an organised event. I'll be cycling the whole 1011 miles and friends will be joining me on some of the legs. Thanks Jon, Clem, Elizabeth, Holly, Clive, Priya and Jo W for doing some pedalling. Friend Jo C will be driving the support vehicle for the whole period in addition to providing emotional support and cups of tea and cake. I'm looking forward to other friends joining as support along the way.

"What are you waiting for?"
